## Installing the server

1. Install [CouchBase](http://www.couchbase.com/), set it up and create at least one bucket.
2. Run `npm install` at the root of the project. Ensure first to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.
3. Create a `config.json` file at the root, or just duplicate the sample `config.sample.json`.
4. Run `npm start` to start the API server.
5. Now you can access the application at `http://localhost:8000/app`.
