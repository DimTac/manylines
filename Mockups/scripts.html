The benefits humans and society can derive from biophysical processes cannot be viewed as objectively existing "" out there"" , but as entangled in social and political processes. This is unpacked through the analytical moments of generation, distribution and articulation of ecosystem services. Social practice moderates the generation of benefits from biophysical processes (through urban development patterns and day-to-day management of urban ecosystems), but also who in society that benefits from them, i.e. the distribution of ecosystem services (viewed here as the temporal and spatial scales at which it is possible for humans to benefit from biophysical processes). Moreover, for biophysical processes to attain value in decision-making, a social practice of value articulation is needed. The framework then moves between two levels of analysis. At the city-wide level, an ecological network translates how urban 'green' areas, viewed as nodes, are interconnected by ecological flows (water, species movement, etc.) where nodes have different protective and management capacities. The network captures spatial complexity-what happens in one location, can have effects elsewhere. At the local level, urban struggles over land-use are studied to trace how actors utilize artifacts and social arenas to articulate how certain biophysical processes are of value. Competing networks of value articulation strive to influence land-use, and multiple local studies bring understanding of how power operates locally, informing city-wide analyses. Empirical studies from Stockholm, Cape Town and other cities inform the framework.

To be sure, there is often what looks like a thing - a newly invented or modified way of thinking or acting, or an artifact, or a system - that is identified in everyday talk as something new. In healthcare, as in almost every other area of human organization, innovations often involve highly organized, institutionally sanctioned, and systematically regulated changes in the structure and delivery of services. This paper presents a theory of implementation and embedding of innovations - Normalization Process Theory - and explores its application to a highly complex ensemble of socio-technical practices, clinical shared decision making. The theoretical analysis presented here shows how implementation as a process and embedding as a state can be conceptualized in terms of social mechanisms that effect changes in the ways that agents' contribute to normative restructuring, the reworking of relational conventions and group processes, the enacting of practices, and their projection into the future.

Which Oedipus is the ""correct"" Oedipus? Questions like these have divided psychoanalysis and fueled debates about it since its inception. In this paper, I explore these issues by outlining and adopting an ""intertextual"" perspective, not to answer such questions but to establish a metatheoretical position that might enable us to step outside of them to consider the broader relationship between theory, myth, literature, and the clinical session. I discuss how concepts such as narcissism and the Oedipal arrangement signify a deeper need for affiliation beyond the content of the myth itself but from within the psychoanalytic field; that they provide a flexible resource but also accrete a historical residue presenting as inertia against a unified psychoanalytic approach. In doing so, the term theory drift is developed to argue that psychoanalytic theory might in part develop through idiosyncratic ""etymological"" processes that reflect an obligation to retain concepts such as Oedipus and a reluctance to break with existing forms and practices. Finally, I discuss emergence and how it signifies the imponderability of the literary and clinical material with which psychoanalysis works, and look to actor network theory to conceptualize the fluid, intertextual networks within which we exist.

It is argued that the economics of convention remain problematic to historians in that they fail to capture the long term transformations traditionally referred to as the emergence of modernity and the coming about of homo economicus. As a possible solution, the use of concepts and insights from Actor Network Theory is proposed. While this cluster of theories enables an historical perspective without considering modernity as a natural process, it confronts changing relationships between subjects, objects and cultural systems of meaning head on.

While having being applied on a number of fields, such as philosophy, sociology, theology, law and political sciences, application of Luhmann's theory is still limited in organization studies (e.g. Munro 2010). In this paper, we attempt to explain the reasons of this ignorance and limited use, focusing on Luhmann's writing style, but also on the theoretical and empirical limitations his theory poses. Believing that Luhmann's theory holds great potential to be applied to organizational studies and explain organizational phenomena, we then discuss how it could contribute to radically changing the conventional ways of studying and analyzing organizational phenomena, fostering at the same time, the debate about the value of his theory. We analyze organizations as communicative processes that continuously produce and reproduce themselves to create knowledge, make decisions, structure expectations, and redefine organizational boundaries. Finally, we address the empirical challenges of applying Luhmann's theory on organization studies.

Building upon community research and applying an actor-network approach, we argue that the 'materiality' of meanings associated with and attachment to the cultural landscape play a significant role in how and why people construct community here. We assert that threats to a loss of a way of life and loss of life are corollaries to finite existence, which together impel residents to rely on community in order to cope with living in 'No Man's Land'. Using oral histories, semi-structured interviews, and participant observation, we show that community is embedded in the cultural landscape in specific ways and practiced, sometimes simultaneously, as both a unified collective body and a group of interconnected individuals.

As a consequence, a functional division between land and sea was created where management objects receive different values depending on whether or not they belong to a ship. The objective of this paper is to review Norwegian CHM underwater policy, and discuss the creation of a new management object and its borders with the introduction of a section on ship finds specifically focusing on Actor Network Theory. It is argued that the understanding of the ship find and its belongings can not be understood as something based on inherent qualities to the management object. Instead this paper proposes to comprehend the ship find as a phenomenon held together within a heterogeneous network.

Scotland is no exception and MSP is central to its management plans. The interpretation and use of spatial data informs these plans and maps provide the backbone of the decision-making process. Whilst not refuting MSP as a governance tool, this paper examines more closely some of the inherent problems with representing marine environments spatially and how the practice of map-making inevitably interacts with social-ecological networks. Borrowing from critical cartography and Actor-Network Theory (ANT), four observations are made: 1) due to the necessary procedure of categorising and simplifying data, maps do not always accurately represent changeable marine environments and situations; 2) maps can produce reality as much as represent it; 3) mapping has become the point through which all actors and stakeholders must pass; 4) as they are obliged to pass through this point, the roles and definition of certain actors can change. This discussion of marine spatial planning in Scotland demonstrates what can be learnt from viewing marine spaces as a tightly coupled social-ecological environment.

This paper draws on actor-network theory to present an in-depth, sociotechnical analysis of one such project - a computer kiosk designed to diagnose and expedite treatment of urinary tract infections (UTI) in adult women. Research at a hospital urgent care clinic demonstrated the kiosk program's effectiveness at diagnosing UTI and reducing patient wait times, and the kiosk was subsequently adopted by the clinic for routine patient care. However, a study promoting the adoption of the device at emergency departments (ED) was characterized by persistent staff resistance and lower-than-expected patient eligibility for kiosk-assisted care. The device was ultimately abandoned at all but one of the new sites. Observations and interviews with ED staff and the design/research team were conducted at four California EDs between April and July 2011 and point to conflicting understandings of evidence for the device's usefulness and reasons for its (non)adoption. The kiosk program's designers had attempted to "" rationalize"" medical work by embedding a formal representation of triage practices in the kiosk's software. However, the kiosk's "" network"" failed to stabilize as it encountered different patient populations, institutional politics, and the complex, pragmatic aspects of ED work at each site. The results of this evaluation challenge the persistent myth that a priori qualities and meanings inhere in technology regardless of context. The design and deployment of new IT projects in complex medical settings would benefit from empirically informed understandings of, and responses to, the contingent properties of human-technology relations.

In this paper, we suggest that a routine emerges from interactions between actors, interactions that are enabled by the exchange of intermediaries. Specifically, intermediaries transmit the intentions of one actor to another and thus potentially align the actions and responses of those actors. If, however, the intermediaries that are exchanged do not clearly transmit the intentions of one actor to another, then a weak routine emerges. Conversely, if intermediaries clearly transmit the intentions, a strong routine emerges in which a given action more often meets with the expected response across iterations. We substantiate our arguments with a field experiment on the towel-changing routine in a hotel where we manipulated the procedure to exchange towels, which resulted in the emergence of a stronger routine. Our study offers several implications for theoretical and empirical research on routines, including to the burgeoning research on micro-foundations. Â© 2012 The Authors.

With proponents of such systems expounding new techniques, a strong normative context emerges for their adoption. Informed by the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS), this study focuses on the discourse used by charitable organizations involved in such investments and how their involvement contributes to the enrolment of vulnerable groups, such as cancer sufferers. A central concern of STS is the strategies scientists use when talking about their work. Methods of communication may often suggest there is only one possible solution to a perceived problem. Such determinism may be reflected in material used by fundraisers where technologies are discussed in a normative, deterministic and definitely desirable way. Charitable organizations in charge of fundraising may thus become deeply enrolled within programmes of development in which the legitimacy of knowledge claims and evidence production are difficult to examine. Methods Drawing on interviews with health-care practitioners and anonymised examples from public fundraising campaigns linked to two UK hospitals, this study explores a theoretical proposition that fundraising materials can be regarded as tools for the enrolment of vulnerable groups in the processes of technological change. Results and Conclusions Where patients are called upon to donate money for the newest, and hence perceived best, equipment, practitioners were of the opinion that unnecessary pressure may be placed on the public to support campaigns, the value of which may be unclear.

First, we will present the epistemological discussion about this radical multiplicity, enphasizing how this debate is attached to the question about psychological scientificity. After that, this radical plurality will be considered beyond the epistemological view, using Bruno Latour, Annemarie Mol and Joh Law's Actor-Network Theory and Isabelle Stengers and Vinciane Despret's Political Epistemology. For these authors, not only is this multiplicity considered positive for science, but the psychologies are considered as subjectivity production devices. These suppositions oriented a group of researches by high-school students in Rio the Janeiro, with the aim of detecting the presencce of these psychologized subjectivities. In the conclusion the results of these researches will be discussed, considering the onthological policies involved in the choices of methods. Â© S.A.C..

The findings introduce the heterogeneity of an enterprise development project at the same time embedded in the concreteness of the workplace innovations and extended beyond the organizational boundaries of the enterprise and the region. The discussions introduce a new and simultaneous rationality of innovation. The contributions to increase competitiveness and productivity become the source of an innovation system and not the result of the regional innovation system.

Kogalniceanu str., 400084, Cluj-Napoca, Romania","In Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle divides human knowledge in three great domains: proper knowledge dealing with the necessary, practical wisdom dealing with good life and good actions, and techne dealing with making artificial things. Aristotle discusses at large theoretical and practical philosophy and ascribes to each of these two domains a specific wisdom. In the case of techne he certainly does not conceive of the existence of a technological wisdom. Nevertheless, the prevalence of technology nowadays requires a deeper theoretical and practical involvement with technology, a technological wisdom, in order to answer its challenges. Carl Mitcham argued that technology can be analyzed on four great components: objects, knowledge, activity (further divided into making and using), and volition. Technological volition and activity are the focus of an ethical approach to technology. In order to argue for such an ethical approach, I will use the insights of Actor-Network Theory and postphenomenology that defined technology essentially as mediator of all aspects of human life. Technologies mediate actions, perceptions, options, decisions, practices and moral values, beliefs and norms. Another important characteristic of technologies is the fact that they become part of technological practices and become part of one's own body schema. Moreover, technologies (software or devices) are social objects that fulfil social roles and are part of social practices; their social functions carry moral norms and values that are encoded into technologies and thus these are genuinely morally charged. On this theoretical background I will analyze the three ethical-relevant components of technology: making, using and willing, and argue for a threefold approach: designing the material conditions for ethical action, meaningful appropriation of technology into one's everyday practices, and conscious control over the production of technological desire.","Affordance; Ethics of technology; Mediation; Practice; Technological wisdom",,,,,,,"Aristotle, (1991) Complete Works, , J.

With this follows that when ecosystem services appear as objects of calculated value in decision-making they are already tainted by the social and cannot be viewed as merely reflecting an objective biophysical reality. Using urban case studies of place-based struggles in Stockholm and Cape Town, we demonstrate how values are relationally constructed through social practice. The same analysis is applied on ecosystem services. Of special interest is the TEEB Manual that uses a consultancy report on the economic evaluation of Cape Town's 'natural assets' to describe a step-by-step method to catalog, quantify and price certain aspects of urban nature. The Manual strives to turn the ecosystem services approach into a transportable method, capable of objectively measuring the values of urban nature everywhere, in all cities in the world. With its gesture of being universal and objective, the article suggests that the ecosystem services approach is a technology of globalization that de-historicizes and de-ecologizes debates on urbanized ecologies, effectively silencing other-and often marginalized-ways of knowing and valuing. The paper inscribes ecosystem services as social practice, as part of historical process, and as inherently political. A call is made for critical ethnographies of how ecosystem services and urban sustainability indicators are put into use to change local decision-making while manufacturing global expertise.

It does so at a time when the discussion of methodological issues appears less important to many empirical accounting researchers than demonstrating a familiarity with the growing range of theoretical perspectives available to pursue such enquiries. The paper initially outlines Laughlin's original and revised frameworks, following which a number of the resultant attributions of specific schools of thought are questioned. The original categorisation exercise is concluded still to offer an insightful basis on which to compare and contrast empirical research approaches. For this reason, the same exercise is extended to locate three further, currently popular ways of seeing: institutional theory, actor network theory and practice theory. The focus then shifts to a more detailed exploration of the relationship that exists between Laughlin's idea of middle range thinking and Merton's characterisation of middle range theory and theorisation. Informed by the resultant insights, the middle range or substantive theory credentials of a range of schools of thought currently widely subscribed in interdisciplinary accounting research are then examined.

The aim is to offer society a critical and creative way to deal with the process in which the electronic and physical dimensions of reality merge and enhance the awareness of the paradigm change that the Internet of Things is bringing to our experience. The article can contribute to the development of a new cognitive paradigm to challenge the current view that objects and environments are inanimate, and the shaping of a framework from which to reconsider interactions between people, social processes, things and environments in the society of knowledge. This framework offers insights into educative, technological developments and cultural programmes to integrate actants (actor-network theory) and citizens in the hybrid experience in which Internet, social processes and matter merge. The objective is to construct the first steps of an analysis framework to understand a few of the most important features that support the emergent model of representation that is impacting the subject's experience with digital data. In order to construct this framework, this research is grounded in the intersection of art, media and experience. The main dimensions analysed in the article are (1) the merging of digital and analogue forms of experience; (2) new actors and forms of interaction; (3) forms of heterogeneous knowledge construction; (4) lively interfaces and animated environments; and (5) biotechnological convergence. The article will show how the outcome of this confluence is taking shape in different forms of (1) indexation, (2) simulation, (3) translation of matter into data and (4) ubiquitous hybrid networks (social+matter/nature).

In disaster management, dominant vertical approaches of organizational and management theory cannot solve persisting coordination problems. This paper proposes an actor-network perspective instead to understand coordination dynamics between heterogeneous local and global actors. It reconstructs dynamics of relief in a sample of disaster management networks after Tsunami 2004. Emergence and coordination of networks are examined triangulating critical incident technique, actor-network approach and content analysis. Disaster management, in an entrepreneurial perspective, appears as critical incident to sustainable local development where opportunities for innovation are seized or wasted. First suggestions regarding better coordination are derived.

Selecting relevant indicators is difficult, especially when monitoring over a longer period of time. Further challenges arise when policies are developed as a collaborative effort among multiple actors.This paper discusses an approach to design frameworks for long-term monitoring and evaluation in multi-actor systems. It uses Dynamic Actor Network Analysis (DANA) as an actor-sensitive method to reconstruct program theories. This is combined with elements of assumption-based planning to identify critical assumptions and associated indicators to incorporate the dynamic aspects related to long-term monitoring.An application of this approach is described for a case of water management in the Netherlands. Here, mapping multiple perspectives and identifying critical assumptions helped to broaden the scope of monitoring in important ways. Identifying associated indicators and expectations on their development in response to policy implementation proved more difficult.From this case, it can be concluded that the approach is feasible, useful, but also demanding. However, with continuing trends of networked governance and adaptive management, additional efforts to reflect these trends in monitoring and evaluation, through this and similar approaches, are needed.

His approach is rich and promising, but two pitfalls should be avoided. First, his concept of 'in-between' runs the risk to conceptualize mediation as a process 'between' pre-given entities. On the basis of current work in postphenomenology and actor-network theory, though, mediation should rather be seen as the origin of entities, not as an intermediary between them. Second, Van den Eede's separate discussion of transparency and opacity in 'use' and in 'context' runs the risk to make invisible the complementarity of the two dimensions. While transparency of use embodies an experiential form of the distinction between transparency and opacity, transparency of context embodies a more cognitive dimension of the distinction. Only by linking the two it becomes possible to take responsibility for the impact that technological mediations can have. Users and designers need a 'double vision' to simultaneously see the transparency of both use and context.

Participants in this study were self-employed workers. The relational and material aspects of work-learning, along with notions of the workspace of the self-employed as hybrid, distributed, and shifting, are considered. This study then examines the work that web-technologies, such as postings, do as they are entangled in an array of networks. Far from being singular objects unified in function, form, or effect, the posting provides multiple entry points for exploring online work-learning practices. The informal learning enacted in this study was the effect of multiple networks and attempts to stabilize fluidity. Different associations with knowledge and novel ways of knowing were also enacted, although there are contradictions between Web2.0 rhetoric and the practices of these self-employed workers. Findings suggest that practitioners and researchers should not be too quick to paint work-learning practices in online communities, or even the notion of online community, with a broad brush.

Drawing upon actor-network theory (ANT)-a perspective that aims to explain how people, their ideas, and the material objects they produce assemble together in dynamic collective activity to attend to a particular issues-this work reveals how those in the school join with a for-profit educational support business, district administrations, and city officials to construct, encounter, and confront the situations created by the miscalculations. What unfolds over the three years after the school is incorrectly labeled as failing is shown to bean example of what is possible, if not probably when accountability-laden, sanctions-drive, and calculation-focused policies, such as NCLB, gain favor. By exploring the gaps between policy texts, policy aims, and their effects, this ANT analysis offers educational practitioners and researchers a way to interrogate and understand the endurance of policies, like NLCB, which show questionable efficacy over time.

Findings from an eight-year longitudinal investigation of the Botox Cosmetic brand suggest that the meanings of a new cosmetic self-enhancement technology evolve over the course of contestations between brand images promoted by the innovator and doppelgÃ¤nger brand images promoted by other stakeholders. Each contestation addresses an enduring contradiction between nature and technology. A four-step brand image revitalization process is offered that can be applied either by managers interested in fostering an innovation's congruence with prevailing social norms and ideals or by other stakeholders (e.g., activists, competitors) interested in undermining its marketing success. The findings integrate previously disparate research streams on branding and market creation and provide managers with the conceptual tools for sustaining a branded innovation's legitimacy over time.

An analysis of the underlying assumptions of BPM shows that it pursues two apparently contradicting goals: on the one hand it aims at formalising work practices into business process models; on the other hand, it intends to confer flexibility to the organization - i.e. to maintain its ability to respond to new and unforeseen situations. This paper analyses the relationship between formalisation and flexibility in business process modelling by means of an empirical case study of a BPM project in an aircraft maintenance company. A qualitative approach is adopted based on the Actor-Network Theory. The paper offers two major contributions: (a) it illustrates the sociotechnical complexity involved in BPM initiatives; (b) it points towards a multidimensional understanding of the relation between formalization and flexibility in BPM projects.","Actor-Network Theory; Business process modeling; Case study; Flexibility; Formalization",,,,,,,"de Albuquerque, J.P., Repensando processos de formalizaÃ§Ã£o em sistemas informatizados: analisando a coevoluÃ§Ã£o entre software e prÃ¡ticas organizacionais (2009) Revista EletrÃ´nica de ComunicaÃ§Ã£o, InformaÃ§Ã£o & InovaÃ§Ã£o (RECIIS), 3 (2), pp. 7-15; de Albuquerque, J.P., Christ, M., Formal models, flexible processes?

Its major theories, the Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) and Actor Network Theory (ANT), have however both been criticized for limiting themselves to the micro-level of cases, impeding a structural analysis of technological systems. This article seeks to bridge any such divides. We research the recent changes in the viticulture of Mendoza, Argentina, which underwent radical changes over the past decades: once governed by low-cost yield maximization, grape production now revolves around ""quality"". To show how the particular quality definition developed, we depart from a social-constructivist framework,following the sociotechnical shaping of problem-solution relationships across the wine production system. To include relevant social groups from different settings around the world, we gradually incorporate the ANT concepts of obligatory passage points, enrollment, convergence, delegation, and codes into the analysis. Combined into the concept of ""sociotechnical alliance"", our analysis follows the dual process of creating agreement while establishing heterogeneous practices across settings at different levels. It shows that functioning involves alliance building and highlights the hybridity and continuous dynamics of systems at large.

It begins by setting out the analytical deficits in the contemporary analysis of consumer debt collection practices, before tracing the industry's responses to the particular problematic of consumer collections. It focuses on the role played by the 'capture of affect' in collections processes, building on existing work exploring socio-economic objects that may be described as 'non-representational'. A richer understanding of the relationship between markets and the body is thus brought to Actor-Network Theory influenced studies of processes of 'economization'. It follows the debtor's progress along collections 'trajectories', exploring different not necessarily compatible modes of captation being deployed by collectors attempting to enact defaulters as repayers, ranging from the quasi-therapeutic to the disciplinary. It concludes by examining the increasing role for performative forms of in vitro and in vivo experimentation being deployed in the collections process, through the use of econometric modelling techniques. Both the debtors' pasts and their actions as they move through the present are shown to provide the empirical grounding for a process of repeated affective 'testing', aimed at discovering - and profiting from - minute variations in debtor dispositions.

However, recent studies have shown that there is a lack of understanding of socio-cultural factors and subtle power relations that brought about these transformations, especially in developing society. Thus, the paper reports a qualitative study in which interviews were conducted and sizeable numbers of open ended questionnaires were administered and analysed based on the Actor Network Theory. The study examines the often overlooked factors that have impacted on the growth of the built environment, by taking a closer look at the urban centre in relation to the main food market called Oja Oba located in the centre of the city of Akure, Nigeria. During the course of the field research, respondents observed that the general appearance of the city, urban lifestyle and city liveability is directly impacted by the issue of food waste, waste generation and waste disposal. This paper concludes that in the drive towards a sustainable city in the developing world and effective waste management there is need to understand the layers of underlying socio-cultural issues that prompted these changes which are subtle and sometime quite sudden with intended and unintended consequences.

""Joining domains"" implies a departure from the linear and technocratic knowledge-translation approach. Integrating the practice, research and policy triangle means knowing its elements, appreciating the barriers, identifying possible cooperation strategies and studying strategy effectiveness under specified conditions.This article examines the dynamic process of developing an Academic Collaborative Centre for Public Health in the Netherlands, with the objective of achieving that the three domains of policy, practice and research become working partners on an equal footing. METHOD: An interpretative hermeneutic approach was used to interpret the phenomenon of collaboration at the nexus between the three domains. The project was explicitly grounded in current organizational culture and routines, applied to nexus action. In the process of examination, we used both quantitative (e.g. records) and qualitative data (e.g., interviews and observations). The data were interpreted using the Actor-Network, Institutional Re-Design and Blurring the Boundaries theories. Results: Results show commitment at strategic level. At the tactical level, however, managers were inclined to prioritize daily routine, while the policy domain remained absent. At the operational level, practitioners learned to do PhD research in real-life practice and researchers became acquainted with problems of practice and policy, resulting in new research initiatives. Conclusion: We conclude that working at the nexus is an ongoing process of formation and reformation. Strategies based on Institutional Re-Design theories in particular might help to more actively stimulate managers' involvement to establish mutually supportive networks.",,,,,,,,,"Jansen, M.W.",,,,,,,,14784505,,,10.1186/1478-4505-10-33,,"English","Health Research Policy and Systems",Article in Press,Scopus

We discuss modernisation as a concept that spans several domains of change including national development, organisational change and epistemological shift. These domains are often categorised into stacked levels, namely the national, the organisational and the individual, or divided into a domain of action and an overarching context. We argue in this paper that an assumption of embeddedness underlies many of these dominant approaches and we identify three issues with this assumption, namely reductionism, unidirectional causality and marginalisation. We draw from the ontological and methodological principles of actor-network theory to suggest a shift towards a more fluid view of the dynamics between the different domains of change. We support our discussion by a case study of the modernisation of the justice system in Morocco, including a national computerisation project of case processing in the courts.

They have serious practical consequences and pose conceptual challenges for conventional international relations theories. This article draws on concepts from actor-network theory (ANT) to analyse the differences between these two mechanisms, their relationship to networks, their differing materialities, and how they succeed or fail. These concepts include actants, translation, enrolment, black-boxing, obligatory passage points, and immutable or mutable mobiles, which together provide useful insights into the way in which humans and objects work together in transnational networks to produce, alter, or resist power. The article argues that ANT can address some problems associated with the concept of governmentality, while complementing its strengths. Numerical indices and peer review processes engage with humans, objects, and networks in different ways and this can alter how larger global forces are or are not transmitted, modified, or resisted. The article explores the empirical relevance of these concepts by examining the World Governance Indicators and the African Peer Review Mechanism review of Benin.

However, much can be gained by including physical objects in the analysis. Using actor-network theory, this paper aims to explore the resistance of non-human actors in organizational change and contribute to an expanded understanding of resistance to change. Design/methodology/approach: The article is based on a longitudinal case study of the introduction of lean in a large Swedish manufacturing company. The empirical basis consists of interviews, observations and document studies. Actor-network theory is used as a theoretical lens to identify non-human resistance to change. Findings: The paper proposes that non-human actors can inhibit change through a lack of alignment with the overall change initiative. This may cause large variation in the interpretation of the proposed change and a lengthy process of construction and negotiation. The paper provides examples of four different types of non-human resistance that result from this lack of alignment. Practical implications: It is proposed that change initiatives need to be aligned with existing practice and anchored in objects that are integrated in organizational routines. The four types of non-human resistance presented in the paper may be used as a checklist to reduce the risk of failure. Originality/value: The predominant focus on social issues tends to disregard the impact of the physical environment in change processes. Actor-network theory and the inclusion of the physical environment will help to expand and improve the understanding of resistance to change.

Using interviews and non-participant observations, this study focuses on the dynamics of actor associations as they are manifested in the efficiency innovations in specimen turnaround times in a pathology unit of an NHS hospital, under actor-network theory principles. We illustrate the emergence of continuous innovation as an actor-network, which is responsible for creating the necessary conditions and behavioural changes for continuous innovation. Furthermore, we explicate the mechanism of translation to represent the 'glue' that keeps the corresponding actors together, contributing to the success of lean in the hospital and subsequently continuous innovation.

The philosophical contribution of the paper pivots around the idea that objects are force-full: smoldering furnaces of affects that are capable of creating, policing, and destroying the very contours of existence. The paper begins with a problem, which is how to account for objects, worlds, and events outside of human consciousness or 'in-themselves'. It answers by constructing an 'evental geography' from the ontologies of Martin Heidegger, Alain Badiou, and Graham Harman. A 'geo-event' names the transformation of a world - from galaxies to nation states to ecosystems - by 'inexistent' objects and the forces they unleash.

We examine the broad social trends and specific historical events that recently affected tourism and discuss how the focus of sociological inquiry in tourism studies shifted from earlier discourses of authenticity and the tourist gaze to three novel theoretical approaches, the mobilities ""paradigm"", the performativity approach and actor-network theory (ANT), which each reflect a broader meta-theoretical re-orientation in contemporary philosophy and sociology. We appraise these conceptual developments and discuss their limitations. We then identify several current research issues as important areas for problem-oriented work at the intersections of tourism and contemporary society: social justice, environmental sustainability, natural disasters, terrorism, heritage, embodiment and affect, and mediatization.

Drawing on actor-network theory as a tool of analysis and way of thinking, this article outlines an alternative, 'performative' account of design pedagogy which both challenges and adds to SchÃ¶n's explanations of design teaching and learning. Close examination of teachers and students in action shows the teacher to be but one of a host of human and non-human actors, all of whom work to assemble what we call a design studio. Learning to 'think like an architect' is but one possible outcome of this assembling process.

In this one, I will discuss how to render such complexity through an original visualization device: the controversy-website. Capitalizing on the potential of digital technologies, the controversy-website has been developed as a multilayered toolkit to trace and aggregate information on public debates.

But the reasons behind this development and its implications for governance practices have not been systematically researched and theorised. This introductory article provides a short overview of the historical and contemporary role of numbers in different governance settings. It includes a discussion of the capacity of numbers to foster social identities, relations and truths across national boundaries, to construct issue areas and to enable various modes of surveillance, communication and action at a distance in the global political economy. It argues that the use of numbers in global governance should not be regarded only as a platform for knowledge sharing and learning. More than this, it needs to be understood in broader terms as a mechanism of inclusion and exclusion from complex social hierarchies and relations, as well as in relation to processes of politicisation and de-politicisation that transcend national spaces.

The present study adds a new perspective to the opening up of this theoretical borderland. In this article, I show how Heidegger's dispute with the philosophical tradition's essentialistic and substantialistic treatment of being, and Latour's dispute with sociology's hypostatisation of the social, share the expression of an epistemological battle against substances, which is most evident in both of their attempts to include technology and things in their thought. Substances are mostly expressed in nouns. Because of this, Heidegger's and Latour's disputes have a grammatical dimension, which in different ways aims to emphasise verbs rather than the nouns in their respective terminology. This grammatical dimension of their shared dispute with substantialism will be demonstrated in this article. I conclude by arguing that Latour's a famous methodological injunction, 'Follow the actors!' can be rewritten as 'Follow the verbs!'.

This article argues that such a tension is productive, and uses an underexplored aspect of marketing - social marketing - to pursue some more conceptual questions about the nature and usefulness of the term 'cultural intermediaries'. It employs a framework loosely derived from actor-network theory to describe the emergence of social marketing in Britain, paying particular attention to the efforts to construct a market for such services, the need to consider material and non-human forms of agency in cultural intermediary activity, and the value of understanding cultural intermediary work in terms of 'culturalisation' - that is, as a process by which some areas of life are designated as belonging to the problem of culture, and others not.

This law is significant for the development of regenerative medicine in the EU and globally. Regulatory texts such as this one provide significant material for addressing key concerns in recent theorising about innovative technologies in socio-legal studies, innovation studies, and science and technology studies. These concerns include expectations about future technologies and economic sector-building. By revisiting philosopher J.L. Austin's well-known work on How to Do Things with Words, this paper deploys his concepts of performative utterances to inform its analysis. Pursuing Austin's and later commentators' analysis of performatives in language use, and drawing on Lindsay Prior's application of actor-network theory to documents, the analysis shows two different types of performativity at work in and through the document. These are termed 'generative' and 'enactive' performativity. The 'enactive' type includes 'legislative' and 'social' forms. In addition, a more conventional content analysis reveals a range of actions, both legislative and discursive, in the regulatory document. The analysis shows a tension between standardisation and imprecision in the conceptual detailing of the document. Legislative texts produced through established politico-legal conventions are a special class of document that should be accorded a more prominent place in understanding the role of political governance processes in shaping emergent technoscientific fields and sectors.

Within the developing country e-business literature, culture has been highlighted as a barrier. Less is however known about culture as an enabler. Despite calls for cultural fit, empirical evidence on how to achieve the fit remains limited. This study follows actor-network theory (ANT) as a lens and interpretive case study as a methodology to understand how funeral culture in the developing country context of Ghana was mobilized for an e-business venture. The findings demonstrate an enabling perspective of developing country culture, complementing the dominant constraining view in the literature. The paper argues that although e-business emerged from the developed world, it could be malleable to varied contexts. The paper encourages developing country entrepreneurs and researchers to seek ways to align e-business to local contexts.","Actor-network theory (ANT); Culture; Developing country; E-business; Ghana",,,,,,,"Akrich, M., The Description of Technical Objects (1992) Shaping Technology/Building Society, , Bijker, W.

Drawing on transcripts of public hearings, local media coverage, and industry and government literature, the article examines the provincial forest industry's attempt to solidify a production-oriented Crown land policy by enrolling different groups of human and non-human actors in its vision. It finds that alliances between industry, government, forest-dependent communities, and the Crown forests themselves were necessary for industry's goal; however, these alliances are not guaranteed and must be actively negotiated by industry. The article ends with an assessment of actor-network theory as measured against a political economy framework, concluding that it offers new understandings of forest debate but also carries important limitations.

Using actor-network theory, we ask how Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) negotiate the agency of educators and how they shape their teaching practice. Since the same kinds of VLE tools have been widely implemented throughout Norwegian education, it is interesting to study how practices are formed in different parts of the educational system. This research is therefore designed as a case study of two different teaching contexts representing lecturers from a higher education institution and teachers from primary schools. Data are collected by means of interviews, online logging of VLE activities and self-reported personal logs. From the analysis of the data, three main networks of aligned interests can be identified. In each of those, the sociomaterial agency of the teaching practice with VLE is crucial in shaping and consolidating the network. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This critical literature on research impact has identified increased client control of research agendas and processes. However, this paper argues that a rigorous conceptualisation is also needed of the precise ways in which urban researchers are themselves able to mould and establish new policy agendas. To this end, it offers a genealogical inquiry into the discursive resources drawn on by housing researchers in a bid to attain agency and direct government policy on housing market renewal. In contrast with representations of housing research as rational and objective, this account offers a means of reconceptualising applied research as a political practice of working within bounded agency spaces.

In doing so, it re-evaluates the status of the political (as opposed to questions of political economy) in Marx's analysis and also reads his argument in light of Actor-Network-Theory's call for the thingness of things to be taken seriously. The paper argues that there is a complex duality to the commodity as it is always comprised of both use-value and exchange-value and hence as both 'natural' and 'social'. It is pointed out that the usual translation of words with the root 'gesellschaft-' as 'social' is unhelpful and that a better term would be 'societal', as this enables Marx, and us, to re-approach the very distinction between the natural, the societal and the social. Marx's notion of 'value as equivalence' is then outlined and it is argued that this crucial stage in his account is often passed over. Value as equivalence is not a mere social production but relies upon the expression of the use-value of one thing in another. This leads to the third move which is an outline of the importance of value-form and social form. It is argued that it is this formation of a commodity (comprising both the natural and the social) which is the key both to understanding it as a specific historical entity as well as offering a powerful, non-reductive, account of the natural, social, material and historical character of things. Overall, the article attempts to develop a novel conception of natural-social commodities which does not premise either side of this dyad and so might help social theorists to talk of real things whilst avoiding charges of essentialism and reductionism as well as possible Latourian critiques of over-generalization.

How, then, does this 'new issue' interact with established organizational processes, and how is climate change 'operationalized' in local practice? Since major events linked to climate change include such things as desertification, climatic migrations, floods and landslides, one might assume that one of its main implications would be a substantial change in land use, or at least a transformation in land organization and management. This article explores the implementation of a 'flood control area' as an adaptation practice in the face of climate change. What theoretical and empirical tools should analysis adopt to account for the multiple actors, types of knowledge, artefacts, socio-technical systems and governance configurations engaged in developing such practices? In other words, to what extent does climate change become a reorganizing category? This article adopts a theoretical approach inspired by actor-network theory and considers adaptation practice not as a standardized top-down solution, but as the result of specific local connections among actors, materials and discourses. The analysis suggests that climate change is indeed a reorganizing category, but one that depends on the specific local materializations of the adaptation measure.

In particular we are interested in the viability of ANT as a lens for studying the past and in ways that can be reconciled with feminist thought. We argue that although there is some non-resonance between ANT and feminist theorizing, using ANT in a critically historicist way allows some of the barriers between ANT and feminism to be broken down. We synthesize an approach to study gendered organizational processes that exist in and over time, identifying and surfacing some of the actants (i.e. human and material factors that encourage people to act) that work together within networks to produce gendered effects such as ongoing discriminatory practices. We trace these effects using the history of Air Canada as an exemplar, in the process noting the conceptual and ontological differences between the past and history. Finally, the advantages of a critically historical ANT are discussed as a way to achieve a level of fusion between ANT and feminist thought.

The majority of the literature looks at organizations from the outside, either treating them as producers of geopolitical representations or as geopolitical actors. An explicit engagement with what organizations are, what makes their actorness and what fashions them with power is missing. This contribution draws on ideas from actor-network theory (ANT) to conceptualize organizations as socio-material networks that emerge from continuous processes of ordering. Tracing these processes along the associations they establish should be an important task of a critical geopolitics. The paper sketches a research agenda around four nodes for such a focus on the socio-material practices of ordering: the circulation of geopolitical ideas, the production of geopolitics, governance at a distance and technologies of ordering.

Cultural theory is examined, which provides a base upon which rural development can identify difference in worldviews based on difference in sociological conditions and environmental phenomena. Actor-oriented theory problematizes the ideal types of cultural theory, providing a means of give-and-take between actors' worldviews of different networks. Actor-network theory breaks down the nature-culture dichotomy of actor-oriented theory, so that nature becomes as 'active' an actor as people and community. Actor-network theory brings nature and society together, perceiving the two as mutually inclusive and constitutive. Coupled with recognition of power associated with political economic/ecological forces, actor-network theory can encourage us to see the frequency of tropical storms in Honduras as being among the powerful actors that have played a significant, consistent role in shaping the mode of ordering of impoverished Honduran peoples. This paper concludes by exploring how alternative, agroecological networks established in a protected area in southern Honduras with 'strong' natural actors can be re-ordered by incorporating autonomy and resiliency into the network.

This article combines both aspects by examining the transnational network formation of one of the most important social movements in late imperial Russia, the Jewish Labour Bund. It furthermore introduces into historiography one of the most fruitful theories in recent social sciences, ""actor-network theory"". This opens the view on the steady recreation of a social movement and reveals how closely the history of the Bund in eastern Europe was interwoven with large socialist organizations in the New World. Based on a large number of sources, this contribution to migration and movement history captures the creation and the limits of global socialist networks. As a result, it shows that globalization did not only create economic or political networks but that it impacted the everyday lives of authors and journalists as well as those of tailors and shoemakers.

The purpose of the paper is to increase understanding of this phenomenon and illuminate the problems that organizations face when trying to establish an information security awareness program. Design/methodology/approach: Following an interpretive approach the authors apply a case study method and employ actor network theory (ANT) and the due process for analyzing findings. Findings: The paper contributes to both understanding and managing security awareness programs in organizations, by providing a framework that enables the analysis of awareness activities and interactions with the various organizational processes and events. Practical implications: The application of ANT still remains a challenge for researchers since no practical method or guide exists. In this paper the application of ANT through the due process model extension is enhanced and practically presented. This exploration highlights the fact that information security awareness initiatives involve different stakeholders, with often conflicting interests. Practitioners must acquire, additionally to technical skills, communication, negotiation and management skills in order to address the related organizational and managerial issues. Moreover, the results of this inquiry reveal that the role of artifacts used within the awareness process is not neutral but can actively affect it. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to examine information security awareness as a managerial and socio-technical process within an organizational context.

To this end, we begin by stressing the need to theorize the past. We develop and describe a concept that we term relationalism, which draws on the sociology of knowledge (SoK) as well as select facets of an approach that has been developed through an engagement with the SoK, that of actor-network theory. The paper offers a theoretical discussion of relationalism as a way of theorizing the past and the past-as-history as an alternative to realism and relativism. We seek an empirical demonstration of relationalism through exploring the wide dispersion and numerous linguistic translations of the work of a scholar who was instrumental in the development of the SoK, that of Max Weber. Relationalism calls for interrogating the politics of representing the past, tracing actors symmetrically and surfacing the past-as-history in its multiplicity. Telling the past relationally calls for an exploration of the tensions between different modes of knowing. To this end, we offer it as a moral alternative.

Our argument in this paper is that the material aspects of these arrangements - and particularly the materiality of prices - need far closer attention than they normally receive. We develop this argument by highlighting two features of new assemblages that have been created in financial markets since 1999. First, these assemblages give sharp economic significance to spatial location and to physical phenomena such as the speed of light (the physics of these assemblages is Einsteinian, not Newtonian, so to speak).

This research aims to promote different articulations between the body and cognition. Based on actor-network theory, it considers that having a body means learning to be affected by widely differing actors. The field research was carried out through body expression activities, which seek to promote connections between the body and heterogeneous materials, such as a ball, a rattle or a colleague. The paper indicates that cognition is the effect of these collective body experiences. It also underlines that these body experiences have produced new ways of knowing amongst the blind and partially sighted youths. In the conclusion it is stressed that psychology research on disability must be done with (and not about) people with visual disability. 1.

In this article, I explore how different kinds of totalities are configured in the practices of such ""locavore"" actors with respect to pigs and pork. Approaches as varied as Sausseurean structuralism, functionalist sociology, and actor network theory characterize their objects of inquiry as totalities constituted by relationships among component parts. So too the totalities in relationships forged via pigs become (mis)aligned with the totality of pigs as embodied, complex organisms. Such wholes from parts reveal the overdetermination (or fetishization) of the ""connections"" (between farmers and consumers, chefs and diners, humans and animals) extolled by ""local food"" actors.

The paper historicizes 'water', and argues that a series of discrete problems that involved water, particularly the reclamation of 'swampland' in the Sacramento Valley, gradually came to be viewed as a single 'water problem' with many facets. My overarching theoretical aim is to rethink the ontology of the technoscientific state through the tools of actor-network theory. I conclude with the following paradox: the more the technoscientific state forms into a complex gathering - or 'thing' - of which humans are part, the more it is represented and perceived as a simplified and singular actor set apart from those same humans.

With such technology having now become widespread, the artistic novelty of this approach has somewhat diminished. While the field of 'locative media' has been and continues to be productive of both work and of critique, this essay questions some of its conceptual commitments and critical interpretations. As the technological assemblages upon which locative media are based are themselves constantly shifting, the essay considers adapting conceptual approaches accordingly. To this end, an argument is put forth for expanding the concept of locative media, built upon Bruno Latour's recent engagement with new media and design practices which he characterizes in terms of the act of assembling rather than debunking. Drawing further on actor-network theory, an alternative interpretation of the metaphor of cognitive mapping is developed in which a core concept of locativity, that of proximity, is redefined in terms of tracing the connections of networked objects, this as opposed to the often repeated association of locative media with Situationist psychogeography. An assembly of practices are examined which trace logistics and give voice to multiple nonhuman ontologies.

Consciously or unconsciously, many organisations focuses more on technology, and take for granted that IT Project does not happen in isolation. The deployments of IT projects are results of people's action which are carried out through processes. IT projects are intended for the support ad enabling of organisation's processes and activities, primarily for sustainability and competitive advantage. As these events (human actions and the processes that they followed) occur and reoccur, different kinds of risks are potential associates. Unfortunately, not all risks are visible or could be easily detected. Even those that are clearly diagnosed, are not as simple as thought in articulation and management. This could be attributed to lack of understanding of the root cause or its manifestations. Hence it was of vital importance to make use of a lens (of actor network theory) in the data analysis.

Both among practitioners and science communication scholars, such practices are often explained with reference to a pervasive ""media logic."" ""Media logic"" is constructed as governing choices and interactions of researchers and journalists. This article critically examines the extensive use of the term ""media logic"" to explain choices, changes or content in media production, and presents Actor-Network-Theory as an approach that invites us to ask what takes place in practice without resorting to such generalizing explanatory devices. The article argues that a quick jump to ""media logic"" as an explanation may imply that we forget its contingency and ignore what actually takes place in journalists' and researchers' negotiations about texts and facts in the mass mediation of science.

Blended learning, or the principled mix of online and classroom-based activities, challenges the practices of traditional CALL and face-to-face teaching within newly emerging, hybrid learning environments. The aim of this study is to examine the role of power in relation to the design of these environments. To achieve this aim, a research team conducted a longitudinal study at two Japanese universities which employed blended learning practices in their EFL programs. We analyzed ethnographic and action research data using postmodern, critical, and ecological perspectives on technology, to explore hegemony in facility planning (online vs. face-to-face), control of materials development (publisher-based vs. teacher-based authorship), and development of software designs (proprietary ownership vs. distributed teacher initiatives). Results of the study reveal three significant changes in power: (a) the construction of classrooms shifted from single-purpose CALL laboratories to blended face-to-face/online spaces, (b) the production of teaching materials emphasized locally authored multimedia materials with a decreasing reliance on mass-market course books, and (c) the design of software modules was controlled by teaching teams for rapid customization. Overall, the process of innovation in institutional programs requires a collaborative management culture to be appropriate and sustainable in university contexts.

However, many municipalities in the United States have been left behind in terms of Internet penetration. Some municipal governments have tried to address this by launching initiatives that aim at offering citywide, universal broadband access. Unfortunately, most of these initiatives either have been discontinued or have ended in failure. Drawing on actor-network theory, we conducted a 3-year study to investigate the evolution of the Internet TV initiative in LaGrange, Georgia, in the United States. The results reveal distinct interpretations of the initiative by different actor groups (the government, the service providers, socioeconomically advantaged residents, and socioeconomically disadvantaged residents), at different stages of implementation, pointing to tensions among the various groups. These tensions reflect the structural problems embedded in the macro political, economic, and societal context. The findings offer insights for policymakers who intend to achieve universal broadband access.

However, mobilization of information technology in e-governance is not a straightforward instantiation of such ambitions but rather a tinkering process in which actors and their interests are combined and transformed. In this paper we examine this idea by investigating the development of a Swedish national public healthcare portal representing a complex, multilevel, and political environment. In this endeavour, the principle of symmetry from Actor-Network Theory and an event-based approach in the analysis play important roles. We show that the development process involves envisioning the future (even if vaguely), implementing concrete ideas about technological functionality and platforms, reconciling diverse interests, prioritizing and framing political concerns and breakdowns, and working toward realization of abstract goals. In this process, the technological actors play a role as important as that of the human actors. The paper concludes that e-governance relationships emerge that rest upon socio-material pragmatics influenced by political transformations that are often unanticipated.

Expressions and concepts such as ""transformations of social worlds,"" ""enactments,"" and ""ontological politics"" provide resources for grasping the ways in which agents actively transform the world and add something new. This has been of immense importance and serves as a warning against reducing events and actors to a given context. But a side effect of this forward looking move is that not enough attention is given to that which enables issues and situations to emerge in the first place. Moreover, the focus on that which is constantly being enacted seems to have privileged the contemporary as the object of study and ethnography as the method of inquiry. History and the study of texts-from the past-seem, increasingly, to get lost in Science and Technology Studies. The aim of this article is instead to use actor-network theory resources as a historicizing method. The article explores the tense concern for the animal in political debates at the turn of the twentieth century. The article argues that contexts should not be seen as something external, but rather integral to the relevant text and situation, thus the very issue at stake.

I trace the processes, beginning in the early 1970s, that constructed first the inefficiency of command-and-control regulation through the distinction between the means and the ends of regulation, and the conversion of the specific 1970 Clean Air Act regulations into the archetypal form of command-and-control. Alongside this, the efficiency of emissions trading was constructed through the provision of empirical, modeling evidence and the re-construction of the Environmental Protection Agency's early Emissions Trading System as an 'ad hoc' implementation of 'pure' economic theory. In this way specific regulatory forms were translated into a seemingly universal economic narrative, and emissions trading was stabilised as a regulatory technology applicable to multiple environmental pollutants.

It uses a resource access perspective of vulnerability, actor-network theory, and qualitative data collection. The analysis reveals that there is interest in disaster risk reduction for the informal settlements; however, there is little in the way of direct financial or oversight relationships between informal settlement residents and all other actors. Respondents observed that informal settlements would probably remain inhabited; thus, there is a need for disaster risk reduction within these settlements. Disaster risk reduction capacity for informal settlements exists and can be further leveraged, as long as steps are taken to ensure appropriate access to and control of resources and oversight. Further, the nascent institutional arrangements should be strengthened through increased communication and coordination between actors, a decentralization of oversight and financial relationships, and mediation of identified resource conflicts.

Policy negotiations concerning the exact nature of the conditions in individual Member States draw on different environmental and economic circumstances and differing interpretations of farmers' role in the rural environment. This article reports on two case studies of decision-making concerning the national cross compliance rules in England and Finland. Actor Network Theory is employed in order to understand how socio-economic and environmental contexts combine to influence and constrain interviewed decision-makers and the propositions they make regarding power and action in the implementation of the cross compliance mechanism. The approach uncovers some significant differences in the normative logic of how cross compliance is interpreted and delivered in the studied countries and highlights how 'baseline environmental standards' imply very different obligations for farmers in different member states. It is evident that a more flexible policy approach is needed to achieve a minimum level of environmental protection throughout the EU.

It proposes that topology should be considered not just as a theory to be adopted, but equally as a device that is deployed in social life in a variety of ways. Digital technologies help to make clear why: these technologies have facilitated the spread of a topological imagination, but they have also enabled a weak form of topological imagination, one that leaves in place deterministic ideas about technology as the principal driver of social change. This paper examines this situation and alternatives to it through an empirical case, that of smart electricity meters. On the one hand, these technologies enable only a limited 'expansion of the frame' on technology, one in which the primacy of technology is maintained. But they are also used to render relations between technology and society more complexly. I explore topological devices deployed in this second way, such as the digital visualization tool of tag clouding and propose that this device enables an empirical mode of critique: here, topology does not just help to foreground the entanglement of the social and the technical, it also helps to dramatize the contingent, non-coherent unfolding of issues.

In this paper, we examine evolutionary, relational and durational perspectives on sustainability journeys. Each perspective emphasizes different facets of sustainability - shifts in selection environments, reconfigurations of emergent networks, and intertemporal comparisons and contrasts. Drawing on our analysis, we discuss implications for sustainability policy, strategy and research. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This creates a framework that can help us capture the ways in which the bourgeois wife, envisaged in the MÃ©nagier as fundamentally disempowered in relation to the husband, could act in pursuit of strategic objectives. The text makes clear the aim of reducing the wife to an actant, dutifully executing her husband's instructions. Indirectly, however, it also discloses women's potential to emerge as autonomous agents. Drawing on anthropological studies of nondiscursive social practices, the essay explores the articulation of practical, moral, and aesthetic imperatives in the MÃ©nagier, and reassesses the text's relation to the social imaginary of the Late Middle Ages, particularly through the comparison with the socioeconomic records of the livres de raison.

Some authors have speculated that carbon can be considered as a form of money (Button; House and Victor). Not only is making money from carbon possible via several market devices but this process has also enabled the construction of carbon as a form of money. The importance of the social underpinnings of the commodification of carbon is highlighted and, following arguments about the performativity of economics (Callon), it is shown that carbon can perform functions similar to those of money. Following Actor-Network Theory, market devices such as registries or exchange platforms are explored to show how the market is constructed through them. Using the work of Zelizer and others on the sociology of money, it is argued that the construction of carbon money should be seen as a fundamentally social (rather than 'merely' technical) process.

BIOX permits each sensor node to autonomously determine its next-hop selection and channel access strategy using bio-inspired next-hop selection and channel access profitability measures. Based on these profitability measures, BIOX provides optimal performance in energy-efficient and reliable sensor-actor communication. Furthermore, using task allocation profitability measure, BIOX also guarantees stable allocation of available tasks in a way that each task is accomplished by an actor node within a bounded time delay. Performance evaluations reveal that BIOX significantly prolongs the network lifetime while providing highly reliable sensor-actor communication and effective task allocation for actor nodes.

An analysis of the ebook environment using genre tracing, Actor Network Theory and a Critical Stance Analysis enumerates the essential connectedness of the ebook and library environment. By restricting access to ebooks to only those who are able to purchase the necessary reading devices, and simultaneously restricting library lending policies, the already existing ""digital divide"" widens to encompass the information contained in digital formats and not merely to access to technology. As a writer and the librarian at a small independent K-through-8 school in Washington, DC, I discuss that the standardization of ebook formats and the free access to books through libraries in whatever format they happen to come, are essential to preserving the open exchange of information and ideas required in a modern democracy, and are key to a productive citizenry. Without agreements that preserve the fair distribution of books and their contents to all through libraries, no nation can hope to remain competitive in a world increasingly characterized by competition for jobs, resources, and information.

Examining relationships among an indigenous protest group, environmentalist grassroots organizations, a human rights lawyer, the mining company, and the provincial government, I argue that power often requires alliances, mediated by compatible translations. However, if alliances are to succeed, at least temporarily, these translations must be made compatible through a process of translation alignment. Ironically, this alignment inevitably alters at least one of the translations, diminishing the power of the actor-network that articulated it to achieve its original goals. This paper's findings also enhance radical geographical understandings of capitalism's infrastructure, as uneven development increasingly relies upon-yet finds it increasingly difficult to achieve-the alignment of local communities' translations with those of the agents of industry.

Drawing on the concept of translation as developed in actor-network theory and found in the literature on knowledge transfer and the sociology of intermediate actors, we build a theory-based model of the translation practices developed by these actors at the interface between community and university. We refine this model by using it to analyse material from two focus groups comprising participants purposively selected because they work at the nexus between research and practice. Our model of translation practices includes cognitive (dealing with the contents of the research), strategic (geared to facilitating the research process and balancing power relationships among the partners) and logistic practices (the hands-on tasks of coordination). Combined, these three types of translation practices demonstrate that actors working at the interface in participatory research contribute to multidirectional exchanges and the co-construction of knowledge among research partners. Beyond the case of participatory research, theorising translation practices helps understand how knowledge is produced at the interface between academic and experiential (or lay) knowledge.

The article is organized into three main parts. The first highlights how the bulk of the literature on the subject has systematically ignored the role of natural/material factors. The second part analyzes the theoretical and methodological contribution of actor-network theory to the analysis of environmental conflicts. Finally, the third part focuses on a case study from northern Italy concerning a conflict over a project for a large-scale municipal waste-to-energy incinerator. The author shows how the outcome of the conflict, namely the failure of the project notwithstanding a convergence of powerful interests, can only be fully understood by adopting a relational definition of agency that sees it as the effect of the process of building associations between humans and nonhumans.

Research on entrepreneurship and innovation in tourism is a relatively novel field of inquiry. This paper deals with the entrepreneurial process through a relational approach in the form of actor-network theory (ANT). It builds on a broad view of entrepreneurship, framing it as the capacity to perceive opportunities for change and the capacity to get things done. It is argued that ANT may serve as a useful device to open up the entrepreneurial process and provide insights into the diverse ways through which particular innovation projects are accomplished. Styles of ordering relational practices are identified as key elements in this regard. These denote methods of associating necessary elements to establish and stabilize particular orders. This paper discusses four styles of relational ordering identified in the translation process of a particular tourism development project in Iceland: the style of economic development, the style of fellowship, the style of ""sparks"" and, finally, the style of ""finding one's sea legs"". It is illustrated how these styles are intertwined and how they are at times difficult to separate in the study of entrepreneurial practices. It is argued that entrepreneurship is always based on diverse styles of relational ordering and, thus for understanding the workings of entrepreneurship, it is important to follow the ways in which they are enacted and continually (re)produced in entrepreneurial practices.

Here, explanation through single meaning is privileged over exploration of multiple presentations of phenomena in short, interpretation eclipses appreciation. This approach is challenged as reductive by naturalistic qualitative methods such as rich ethnographic field reports, presented as narratives. Contemporary ethnographic approaches have entered medical education by a back door disguised as a stable of 'social learning theories'. Communities of Practice theory, Activity Theory and Actor-Network-Theory (ANT) all serve as research practices forming identifiable contemporary ethnographies. 'Evidence' is conceived as exploratory rather than explanatory, through baroque descriptions of innovations in learning organizations, including medicine. ANT is then both a theory of innovation in organizations and an ethnographic method, where practice and theory coincide. ANT is interested primarily not in epistemologies, but in how a phenomenon such as an 'illness' is conceived across differing practices as multiple ontologies (experienced meanings), each meaning generated and suspended within a particular network of effects. How such networks are initiated and developed has significance for rethinking the nature of 'evidence', restoring faith in the value of a good story.

Asked to speak about the responsibilities and opportunities for historians of technology and science working on Asia, I tried to situate the question within contemporary South Asian realities. In the broadest terms, I lay out the widespread conflicts and displacements that had been engendered by the megatech projects undertaken in the name of development and mobilized through the apparatus of the special economic zones (SEZs). Within this context, I suggest that fear had become a valuable political resource through which opposition to the projects was crystallized. Often irrational and frequently obscurantist, these fears nonetheless managed to trip up the iniquitous developmental juggernaut. As local fears hybridized, borrowed from, and traveled beyond their initial spheres of articulation, they created an intricate ecology of fear within which postcolonial megatech projects had to survive. Actor network theory, I argue, is insufficiently sensitive to these lurking irrationalities that haunt postcolonial technonational developmentalism, and if scholars want to understand the history and sociology of these projects, they have to take these fears and their politics mobilization seriously.

In order to question the power afforded to units, we work at the intersection of theoretical debates concerning biopower and governmentality; emotional, embodied and affective geographies and actor network theory. Presenting empirical research from the UK we contribute to geographical agendas that seek to consider the ontological and epistemological understandings of alcohol, drinking and drunkenness.

This paper therefore argues for investigations of relational spaces of industrial ruins in order to capture their potential within green structure planning. The breakdown of the former order and the establishment of new heterogeneous relationships need to be regarded as vital background information when reinterpreting the ruin as part of the green structure. The concept network ruin is introduced here to inspire further studies of the shattered actor-network and its inertia. In order to illustrate the concept, the paper presents a case study of the ruins related to a former railway in southern Sweden. The transformation of one part of the embankment into a multifunctional greenway is studied in detail and the process of dismantling the ruin (metaphorically and literally) within planning and the public debate is scrutinized. Finally, relational spaces of the ruin are compared with the spatially and conceptually limited discourse on the greenway, in order to illustrate the fruitfulness of a more inclusive analysis.

It has turned from a gradually intensifying, long-term challenge into a highly nonlinear danger that threatens national security. This article explores the reasons, and points to the consequences, of this change. Drawing from actor-network theory, it argues that practices and materials have become entangled across professional and disciplinary contexts. The growing association of chaotic climate change encompasses climatologists, who challenge the mainstream ontology of climate; economists, who started to revisit their economic models; and strategic communities, which began to pick up nonlinear climate changes foregrounding national security. Methodologically, the principle of symmetry that underlies this research aims, as far as is possible, to transcend the dualistic notions of science and politics, and society and nature.

They outline a framework that situates assemblage, a notion utilized in actor-network theory, within the critical cultural study of policy. Treating policy assemblage as a dynamic cultural form, they argue, provides a way of revealing the complexities of sociomaterial connections inherent to policy implementation. The authors pay particular attention to what happens when disparate actors join together to perform policy-directed tasks. It is within these heterogeneous and hybrid linkages that policy negotiations and controversies can become productive play. The authors briefly discuss the dynamic composition of productive policy play. Then, applying it to a controversy revealed in the ethnographic analysis of No Child Left Behind conducted by the first author, they demonstrate the framework's usefulness in considering the sociocultural processes of policy in action.

With a particular focus on primatology, it explores how these developments challenge the notions of ""culture"" that continue to inform the study of human social life. The article argues that this growing challenge to the assumption of human uniqueness that has historically provided the core rationale for sociology cannot be ignored. The paper thus contributes to the overdue work of articulating a constructive response by tracing the issues involved in the encounter between these knowledges. Theoretical currents from science studies and actor-network theory are drawn upon in order to propose a reflexive and symmetrical realignment of this encounter, with significant implications for our understandings of human and animal being and subjectivity.

It argues that these two research programmes can be understood as symmetrical twins. We show the extent to which the exchange between Bruno Latour and Luc Boltanski has influenced their respective theoretical developments. Three strong encounters between the twin research programmes may be distinguished. The first encounter concerns explanations for social change. The second encounter focuses on the status of objects and their relationship to places. The third encounter is about the concept of critique. Drawing on their long-term mutual readings, we gain insight into how pleas for symmetrical analysis raised in response to Bourdieu's theory of fields have evolved within both ANT and the sociology of critical capacity. We conclude by relating the development of the respective research programmes to the issue of disciplinary boundaries.

Reconstructing the process of no-tillage development in Switzerland has made it possible to show that no-tillage development may be regarded as a dynamic process of co-creation of innovation, where human and non-human actors are building networks by reciprocally transforming and translating each other and the relations between them. This conceptualisation reveals that spread of no-tillage requires fundamental transformations within the network of conventional plough-tillage agriculture, including institutional arrangements, farm equipment, work organisation, concepts of agriculture and personal and professional identities. Against this background, the limited spread of no-tillage-despite its economic and ecological advantages-can be explained by the fact that the required transformations are too radical for many agricultural actors. This conceptualisation also implies that policy interventions are not understood as top down measures that intend to induce one-to-one direct causal chains between knowledge and action of farmers, but as mediators in a complex process of reciprocal translations between farmers, experts and scientists, as well as many non-human actors. We conclude that investigating processes of cocreation of knowledge from the perspective of actor-network theory is a promising complement to hermeneutic approaches to co-creation of knowledge such as social learning.

A focus group was conducted with individuals with ALS (n=8) and their caregivers (n=9) to determine the barriers to and mediators of BCI acceptance in this population. Two key categories emerged: personal factors and relational factors. Personal factors, which included physical, physiological and psychological concerns, were less important to participants than relational factors, which included corporeal, technological and social relations with the BCI. The importance of these relational factors was analysed with respect to published literature on actor-network theory (ANT) and disability, and concepts of voicelessness and personhood. Future directions for BCI research are recommended based on the emergent focus group themes.Practitioner Summary: This manuscript explores human factor issues involved in designing and evaluating brain-computer interface (BCI) systems for users with severe motor disabilities. Using participatory research paradigms and qualitative methods, this work draws attention to personal and relational factors that act as barriers to, or mediators of, user acceptance of this technology.

It is argued that current policy and legislative approaches to Construction Hazard Prevention through Design (CHPtD) are inherently limited because they do not adequately reflect the socio-material complexity of decision-making in construction design. Specifically, the simplistic attribution of responsibility to a single socio-technical actor, 'the designer', does not reflect the multiple and disparate influences that impact upon OHS outcomes. Nor do existing CHPtD policy frameworks, management processes and tools recognize the manner in which the interactions and associations between relevant project stakeholders and various non-human artefacts shape (and are also influenced by) the evolution of design decisions. Drawing on actor-network theory (ANT) and using embedded units within a case study approach, the interactions between human actors and non-human artefacts are explored in relation to the design of four components of the food processing facility. The way in which design decisions unfolded and shaped OHS experiences during the construction stage of the project is revealed. The research highlights limitations inherent in current approaches to the management of CHPtD and the need to develop a more robust theoretically based approach to integrating OHS considerations into construction design practice.

I examine three different and overlapping performances of GM canola: as an agronomic object, a risk object and a market object. I focus on how each performance effects similarities and differences between GM and conventional canola that are productive of ontological distinctions that make GM canola controversial. I argue this analysis offers useful insights that are not revealed by more traditional explanations of controversy.

Specifically, we propose a semidistributed localization algorithm in which a small subset of sensors extracts their positions in polar coordinates based on the messages received from the actor, and subsequently localizes (also in polar coordinates) the remaining sensors. By modeling the deployed sensors as a two-dimensional Poisson point process and applying well-known results from the coupon collector's problem and Chernoff bounds, we analytically derive and also validate, by simulation, the sensor density required to localize all sensors in the network with high probability. The actor-centric network can be modeled by a cluster adjacency graph G with the help of the already localized polar coordinates that logically partition the network into concentric coronas (around the actor), each subdivided in a varying number of clusters (of almost the same area). To avoid intercluster collisions in G, sensors in different clusters transmit on different channels. A lower bound on the number of channels required to schedule the transmissions without collisions is obtained by solving a distance-2 vertex coloring problem on G. Optimal and quasioptimal fully distributed algorithms are provided to determine the channel assigned to each cluster in constant time. Finally, we apply these results to develop a geographic routing protocol: the messages generated from the sensors in a given cluster are routed toward the actor through the unique shortest path of G that starts from the node associated with the cluster and goes up to the corona where the actor resides. In each cluster, to avoid redundant retransmissions toward the actor, we select L leaders, one for each periodic sleep-awake schedule. Â© Wiley Periodicals, Inc. NETWORKS, Vol. 2012.

The anthology edited by KONTOPODIS and NIEWÃHNER presents contributions that draw on relational-materialist concepts in order to praxiographically study how both human and non-human agents transform (mostly biomedical) everyday practices. This review attempts to connect these material-semiotic descriptions to a critical psychological perspective. It highlights how the contributions' focus on material things' actions is valuable for further unraveling the humanworld relationship. Meanwhile it questions whether the underlying conceptual framework allows for an emancipatory science which strives for transformations that reach beyond the mere descriptive level.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper outlines two theoretical perspectives on interfirm control: an ostensive TCE perspective and a performative ANT perspective. By contrasting these perspectives the different assumptions of each perspective are highlighted. By connecting them, potentially interacting research approaches become visible. Findings - Ostensive research and performative research may be two sides of the same coin. Ostensive TCE-based research produces intentional explanations for the choice of certain control structures, while performative research exposes the mobilization of control structures in specific episodes from practice. Interaction between the two potentially accelerates and enhances knowledge production on control in interfirm relationships. TCE-based ostensive research produces conceptualizations that can be followed as actors, thus enabling a demonstration of their enactment. Conversely, ANT-based research may challenge the stability of (con)text as it is perceived in TCE-based research. Originality/value - The paper offers a base for multi-paradigm research into control of interfirm transactional relationships. Specifically, the paper offers a base for connecting TCE-informed research and ANT-informed research into interfirm control.

However, this discursive inflation has come hand in hand with a certain destabilization of the geographic conceptualization of public space. From modern thinking we inherited certain methodologies constricted to a predictable, boring network of binary oppositions, and their exhaustion prevented new, original findings or descriptions. On the other hand, out of some rare ontological debate has emerged another more creative and experimental epistemology which will lead to new paradigms -e.g. the consideration that any research about public space must be addressed from a perspective based on a multiplicity of relationships that refuses to take public space for granted and questions the more normative approaches.","Actor-network theory; Epistemology; Non-representational theory; Performativity; Process; Public space","conceptual framework; geographical theory; human geography; public space; theoretical study; urban area",,,,,,"Otazu, A., Usos y significados del espacio pÃºblico.

Specifically, it focuses on the shift to farming techniques that have eliminated plowing, bringing to light four major mechanisms constitutive of dissociation: centrifugal association; making entities and associations visible; making other entities and associations invisible; bringing together or Â« associating Â» new entities. The study helps refine our understanding of the detachment processes at work in most innovation, shedding light in this particular case on transfers between public research institutes, industrial companies and citizens all seeking to develop new farm production models.",,,,,,,,"Abernathy, W.J., Clark, K.B., Innovation: Mapping the winds of creative destruction (1985) Research Policy, 14 (1), pp. 3-22; Akrich, M., La description des objets techniques (1987) Sociologie de la Traduction.

By analyzing the constructed network of actors we realize that lack of convergence between IT and CS is the main reason that CS is less applicable and less developed. In addition, we learn from this study that IT has extra influences on CS. So, convergence of the viewpoints of their actors is essential in order to gain further success at CS.

However, little is known about how VLE tools are used in various forms of assessment and what kinds of teaching practice the use of such technologies brings about. Based on interviews and personal diaries, actor-network theory is applied to describe and understand emerging teaching practices with VLE tools, such as multiple-choice tests, portfolios and collaborative writing tools. A tight relationship is found between the documentation of student attainment, the teacher-student-parent conference and the use of VLE tools, all constituting a network of aligned interests in assessment. Practitioner Notes: What is already known about this topic â¢ The use of educational technology (e-assessment) brings about new assessment practices such as peer- and self-assessment. â¢ Most studies in e-assessment are related to higher education and further education. â¢ There is a growing interest in how e-assessment can foster new educational goals, such as metacognition, creativity, project work and communication skills. What this paper adds â¢ A primary school perspective on e-assessment, in particular the implementation of e-assessment in a school system where traditional grading is not applied. â¢ An insight into how the virtual learning environment plays a part in establishing a new assessment practice. â¢ Deeper knowledge about the usefulness of actor-network theory in empirical educational research. Implications for practice and/or policy â¢ There is a need for a critical perspective on virtual learning environments as tools for assessment and what kinds of pedagogical philosophies they can support. â¢ The use of a virtual learning environment can foster certain assessment practices, and has the potential to influence assessment policies at all levels of education.

Through a drawing together of elements of actor-network theory and regionalization theory, it is argued that the adoption of the EUSBSR can be seen as a milestone within a wider process towards Baltic Sea regionalization, whereby the Baltic Sea region is increasingly 'solidified' through the positioning of the European Commission as a spokesperson for the interests of the region. It is further suggested that, if not seriously contested, the possible acceptance of the European Commission as a designated regional spokesperson might be a crucial step in a process whereby the soft space of the Baltic Sea Region may gradually become more formalized. Nonetheless, caution must be taken so as not to confuse degrees of formal institutional fixity with degrees of durability.

OST was used to construct a model of the tobacco problem as a management system acting in a broader environment. This highlighted several problems with the current system but provided no mechanism for reform. ANT, the ""sociology of translation,"" was used for understanding how change occurs. Unlike systems thinking, ANT focuses the contest for change on heterogeneous networks of human and nonhuman actors that must be constructed through a process of defining and defending models of change, building alliances, gaining public acceptance, and finally achieving institutional acceptance of the reform (or of some compromise). We then show how this dual approach can shed light on a current challenge in controlling tobacco, the issue of product regulation, and the broader issue of harm reduction versus harm elimination.

It focuses on the significance of ANT's rejection of the subject-object distinction for recent debates in human and cultural geography regarding the role of social contexts in mediating the character and experience of AOD consumption. In exploring this theme, I apply insights derived from the work of Bruno Latour and John Law to the analysis of qualitative data recently collected in studies of AOD use in Melbourne, Australia and Vancouver, Canada. These studies indicate that AOD consumption is a relational achievement involving diverse objects, spaces, actors and affects. The paper goes on to argue that social contexts may themselves be understood as discrete assemblages of such objects, spaces and actants. This suggests a novel basis for investigating the role of social contexts in mediating AOD consumption in particular sites and settings. The paper closes with an assessment of the implications of these arguments for the ongoing design of novel, place-based approaches to the study of AOD use within human and cultural geography. I emphasise the need for greater recognition of the agentic force of spaces, objects and actants, such that research designs more sensitive to the dynamics of context might be elaborated.

Based on the review, three different approaches are distinguished: structural, actor and agency. In the structural approach the dynamic of policy change originates in well-established structures. The actor approach focuses on either individual or institutional actors as the drivers of policy change. The agency approach understands higher education policy change as an interactive process between various actors and domains within transient structures. We will also present two emerging, alternative approaches: actor-network theory, which takes interaction as a starting point and proposes that no organization or agent is ever autonomous; and a discursive approach, which sees higher education policy change as a discursive process.

Much geographical work has critically focused on state-environment links, while economic geographers have attempted to theorize the emergence of markets and economies, in part through understanding the economy through a relational, cultural lens. However, while there has been significant work on critical approaches to the environment and capitalism, there has been a lack in explicit focus on the firm and its role, firstly, in mediating economic-environmental relations, and secondly in the production of specific environmental outcomes. Drawing on literatures on cultural political economy (CPE), Science and Technology Studies (STS), Actor Network Theory (ANT) and political ecology, the paper argues for a reincorporation of the firm into critical work on the environment in geography, and proposes three ways in which the firm can be usefully theorized in such work: as a relational economic and cultural actor, as a sociotechnical mediator, and as the producer of hybrid socionatures.

This paper explores what constitutes an intervention that works from the perspective of health promotion professionals (HPP), and how, according to them, the development and implementation of interventions should be improved. We interviewed 81 HPPs about the use of 10 health promotion interventions at 30 Municipality Health Services in The Netherlands. The HPPs described an intervention that works as something that produces its intended effects after being realized in a local situation. Interventions are realized by combining elements of a supplied intervention (e.g. a theory, artefacts) with elements that are situated in the local context (e.g. funding, local network). Interventions that are transferred contain implicit assumptions about local contexts, but it is often unclear what precisely constitutes an intervention and what is assumed of local contexts. An intervention that works is a situated configuration of aligned elements. A linear EB approach depends on the realization of the local circumstances in which 'evidence based' interventions can work. Various strategies are possible for approximating such circumstances, but the core assumption that the configuration that is realized in practice is similar to the 'evidence based' intervention seems unrealistic for most health promotion in the Netherlands. Under such circumstances, attention should shift from central quality assurance to the system of actors and the distributed actions and heterogeneous learning processes that together add up to interventions that work.

How these transitional environments can be effectively planned and managed has led to the creation of new planning instruments. Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) has been widely promoted as a potential mechanism for effective and integrated planning and management of these areas. However achieving the aspirations for ICZM is complex not least because of the many human activities and diverse regulatory regimes that exist in coastal areas, whose interest and concerns must be effective integrated into a single policy and implementation regime. Within the context of the developing world countries there have been few critical and analytical evaluations of why ICZM experiments have failed. This paper seeks to begin to address this gap by suggesting that Actor Network Theory (ANT) is an appropriate analytical framework to critically evaluate why ICZM initiatives in Egypt, at both the national and local level, have been relatively unsuccessful. The critical evaluation leads to some practical recommendations that could help to enhance the implementation of ICZM in Egypt and other developing countries.

The received view in education is that affect is tantamount to emotion or feeling and that materials, such as bodily affectivity, technologies and texts, are used by teachers and learners to support and advance teaching and learning. Telling a sociomaterial story, I account for how materials participate in pedagogic practice and for what is performed through this participation (e.g. corporeal capacity, changed power relations regarding the subjectivities of teacher and learner and teaching and learning). Drawing on video case data collected as part of a national study, and utilising an analytic of assemblage, I trace affective relations in action towards making an argument about the centrality of affects, as socio-material practices, to teaching-learning events in school classrooms and beyond. Registering bodily as intensity, affect effects change in pedagogical relationships, impelling acknowledgement of its substantive nature and its political import. Altogether, bodily matter matters. Implications of this mattering for education policy and practice are drawn out.

This article presents an account of how an ANT analysis of socio-material practices with a focus on objects can bring informal learning and identity formation to view. It is based on a doctoral study of the everyday practices of women in voluntary community organisations in a rural town in Victoria, Australia. In the absence of formal representational learning, an analysis of data with a focus on the centrality of objects to learning in practices and processes shows how relations of different entities can be traced in material enactments of learning and identity. The emergence of a new dimension in learning (materiality) changes the whole methodology of learning, and a new understanding of learning has implications for pedagogy and adult education.

An ethnographic study on epistemic objects in science education is the basis for the analysis of two of these objects: experimental arrangements and the blackboard. While experimental arrangements configure students as witnesses of the fascinating otherness of material objects, the blackboard enacts students as recorders of semiotic representations. In the interplay of these socio-material enactments scientific knowledge receives its authority in the classroom. The perspective adopted in this article highlights the bodily and sensory dimension of material objects and thus helps to understand how human-technology relations are established.

Web technologies amplify this fluidity and online learning now encompasses a plethora of practices. In this paper I focus on the delete button and deleting practices of self-employed workers engaged in informal work-related learning in online communities. How the relational and material aspects of online pedagogical practices are being negotiated is explored. While deleting appears to be an everyday practice, understanding the delete button as a fluid object in fluid space begins to illuminate its complexity and multiple enactments. Deleting practices which work to stem the tide of information pushing itself on to screens, as well as those practices that attempt to delete traces left behind on screens and 'in the cloud', are examined. Actor-network theory provides the theoretical and conceptual tools for this exploration. I conclude with observations on the politics of the delete button and implications for more sophisticated digital fluency in everyday pedagogy.

For conceptualizing far-reaching urban infrastructural change processes, the combined innovation frameworks of ""strategic niche management"" (SNM) and the ""multi-level perspective"" (MLP) on ""systems in transition"" offer valuable contributions. However, some implicit assumptions of these innovation frameworks make them not unproblematic when applied to the urban. This paper proposes a way of operationalizing the SNM/MLP for urban transition studies, by drawing on contributions from actor-network theory (ANT) and ANT-inspired scholarship. From this conceptual engagement, a refined understanding of the relationship between technological novelty and the existing obduracies, or ""lock-in"", is developed, which enables a fuller appreciation of the potential heterogeneity of ""lock-in"" and the cumulative impacts of different actors' strategic technological interventions in reconfiguring deeply engrained patterns of obduracies in their efforts to promote a specific technology; thus providing scope to link the analysis of local processes to insights into the more general processes of transforming unsustainabilities.

This article reports on a pilot-study that applies a sociotechnological 'lens' to examine this standardisation process in educational policy. In line with ethnographic analyses drawing on science and technology studies and actor-network theory, the authors present a case study of teacher education in Flanders to demonstrate empirically how professional standards for teachers are being translated in (material) reality. First, we show where the Flemish professional profile and the core competencies of the teacher are being inscribed in teacher education. Second, we register how they gather an assembly of people, documents, procedures, instruments, etc. into specific types of stable and self-evident practice, and, third, we describe who and what is therefore set in motion. By displaying where the core competencies of the teacher function as 'obligatory points of passage', we make visible how their activity intensifies the standardisation network. This indicates, then, how the presence of professional standards in education is being stabilised or 'black boxed'. Thus, our analysis traces the role played (or the type of work done) by professional teaching standards.

It engages with the relations between climbers, their kit and the places in which they climb to explore how during the situated practice of climbing, climbers and material artefacts co-evolve resulting in a diverse array of synergies that co-enable the climb. Differing roles and functions emerge and are negotiated between climber, crag and kit. These roles and functions go beyond those detailed by manufacturer-ascribed use-values that define their 'proposed' or 'proper' role/s and limits within the climber's safety assemblage. Drawing upon semi-structured interviews with climbers, I use Actor Network Theory to explore the enabling, situated, contingent and co-emergent relations between climbers and their kit and show how more-than-representational dimensions of their environmental engagements are dependent upon entering into symbolic and synergistic relationships with material others.

Shown here in an application to the Maaritsa border change controversy, which took place in Estonia 2001-2003, the approach has several merits compared to now dominant analytical perspectives in regional geography. The rejection of a regional imagination, as the natural way of conceptualizing provinces, is used to demonstrate that Estonian provinces and provinciality are performed, and can be analytically described, through multiple and complex spatialities. First, the inoperative character of provinces in the everyday life of many peripheral households is understood to be the result of incoherence in regional space between rigid administrative and fluid non-administrative provinciality. Second, the problems with long distance control in the Estonian governmental system, related mainly to the ambiguous character of legislation and unstable politico-administrative coalitions, are identified as the main cause of failure in the government's attempt to change provincial borders in regional space. Third, provincial research is seen as the practice that attempts to translate two other provincial modalities - provinces in everyday life and in governmental provincial politics - into a report designated to provide a synoptic and simplified view of complex peripheral provinciality for the central government. The article concludes with the argument that these three provincial modalities are intertwined in practice and their performances reciprocally determined.

Since the 1970s the program elaborates a first generation version of the activity theory approach to learning and development, closely following the works of Vygotskij and Leont'ev. The research program is connected to a broad actor network bringing teachers, educators, and researchers together who share the commitment to Vygotskij's developmental theory and methodology. The mission of the research program is the collaborative constitution of a Vygotskian form of school education. In the elaboration of the research program it is demonstrated how this research program problematises some of the core concepts of current Vygotskian theory, and how these conceptual and associated empirical and practical problems are solved. On account of the problem solving potential of the research program, it is argued that this research program has proven to be progressive over the past decades.

What happens when this approach to materiality takes on the question of law? One answer is suggested by Bruno Latour's recent ethnography of law making in France's Conseil d'Etat. Interestingly, this study turns out to be not so much an actor-network theory of law as occasion to add a new dimension to the material worlds of actor-networks, namely, the communicative dimension of 'regimes of enunciation'. My hypothesis is that this distinction between the sociality of actor-networks and the logic of enunciation is problematic because it uncritically adopts the premise that there is an institution such as 'law' that has to be explained or materialized by social science, thereby diminishing the critical energy that the theory of actor-networks or of dispositifs might bring to the study of law.

Foucault, L'archÃ©ologie du savoirLuhmann, N., (1995), Social Systems For systems theorists, materialities have to include their own observation; materiality only exists as a referent of communications, which necessarily presuppose an observer or an idiom of observation(1990), One might say the same of the approach taken by Cornelia Vismann, whose work has obvious affinities with Friedrich Kittler's historical analysis of communications and, in particular, the medial schemata that constitute the 'historical' or 'anthropological a priori' for the existence of 'so-called Man' (see F. Kittler, Gramophone, Film, Typewriter () 29 and 117, respectively), but also incorporates perspectives in everything from psychoanalytical theory to actor-network theoryLatour, B., La fabrique du droit: Une ethnologie du Conseil d'Etat (2002), p. 268Latour, B., (1996), Aramis, or the love of technologyLatour, B., (2005), pp. 34-40. , Note brÃ¨ve sur l'Ã©cologie du droit saisie comme Ã©nonciation' in Pratiques cosmopolitiques du droit, eds.

Instead of sending the listener of a story into a different world, the technical shifting-out inscribes the words into another matter. It might be, however, that the space-time of text is the basic archetype; Latour's studies of the scientific laboratory were primarily about inscriptions, about differences and tensions between texts and inscriptions, or about the 'cult of the inscription' in the laboratory (see H. Schmigden, 'Die MaterialitÃ¤t der Dinge? B. Latour und die Wissenschaftsgeschichte' in Bruno Latours Kollective: Kontroversen zur Entgrenzung des Sozialien, eds. G. Kneer, M. Schroer, and E. ShÃ¼ttpletz(2011), For a different ethnographic construction of an aspect of lawmaking, see A. Riles, Collateral Knowledge. Legal Reasoning in the Global Financial Markets(2001), pp. 21-44. , Hence the observation that, rather than resolving disputes, legal procedures actually 'expropriate' the conflict and its parties by parasitizing their 'energy' (see G. Teubner, 'Alienating Justice: On the surplus value of the twelfth camel' in Law's New Boundaries: The consequences of legal autopoiesis, eds. J. PribÃ¡n and D. NelkenPresumably, law might also exist as an institution, and hence as an actor-network, but Latour's representation of law as a mode of enunciation, or as a mode of binding or concatenating statements, makes it difficult to see how one would retrace one's steps back to this other existenceLuhmann, N., (1997), pp. 3-28. , Law as a Social System (2007) and G.

Together with constructivist frameworks and ethnographic approaches it has allowed the development of rich local pictures of the immediate and adaptive response by user organizations to the take-up of what are, today, often generic packaged systems. However, to view the packaged enterprise solution principally at the place where the user encounters it also has limitations. It produces somewhat partial understandings of these complex artifacts. In particular, it downplays important influences from other sites and time frames. This paper argues that if we are to understand the full implications of enterprise solutions for organizations then we should study their ""biography."" This idea points to how the career of workplace technology is often played out over multiple time frames and settings. To understand its shaping therefore requires scholars to go beyond the study of technology at a single locale or moment and, rather, attempt to follow it through space and time. The paper develops two ideas to aid this kind of study. We discuss better spatial metaphors that might help us explore the hybrid and extended spaces in which packaged software systems develop and evolve. We also review improved temporal understandings that may capture the multiple contemporary and historical time frames at play. The paper concludes by discussing some possible research directions that a focus on the biography of a technology might allow.

To investigate this diffusion, we suggest tackling CCTV as a socio-technical device able to enrol allies beyond the initial circle of technology promoters, including former opponents. Through an empirical analysis of three case studies, we show that a device can spread on a site provided that the actors in charge of the device appropriate it and discover new practical uses. As appropriation practices give CCTV supporters new arguments to justify its use, CCTV is therefore more legitimized by the possible combinations of different arguments and uses than by its strictly speaking effectiveness to fight against crime.

ANT is deployed in a study of the evolution of divided regulatory responsibility for tobacco and medicinal nicotine (MN) products in the United Kingdom, with a particular focus on how the latter came to be regulated as a medicine. We examine the regulatory decisions taken in the United Kingdom in respect of the first MN product: a nicotine-containing gum developed in Sweden, which became available in the United Kingdom in 1980 as a prescription-only medicine under the Medicines Act 1968. We propose that utilizing ANT to explore the development of nicotine gum and the regulatory decisions taken about it places these decisions into the wider context of ideas about tobacco control and addiction, and helps us to understand better how different material actors acted in different networks, leading to very different systems of regulation.

Crook reverses the Beckian axiom that risk is the unintended outcome of the failure of industrial societies, arguing for an understanding of risk within a Foucauldian and Actor Network Theory of governmentality. Risk becomes a mechanism for the realisation of different dreams of order. The welfare state was the risk management mechanism of organised capitalism. Individual aspirations of reflexive individuals form the risk management mechanism of neo-liberal regimes. As competing risk discourses destabilise the field of maternity care, key actors (including doctors, midwives, women and policymakers) form themselves into neo-traditional communities in ongoing struggles to have their risk claims institutionalised within policies and protocols that further legitimise their interests. These struggles around risk and power are evident in recent debates over maternity policy in the context of the 2009 Maternity Services Review and the policy aftermath.

This kind of critique counters the ways regimes of power are materially entrenched. This article explores such an alternative conception of critique by drawing on Butler's notion of performativity, the agential realism of Barad and the ontological politics of Mol. It explores the particular ways in which actor-network theory could be understood as a resource of critique. Because of its central role in the enactment of reality, Education is an important field within which critique is developed further in relation to ontological and epistemological assumptions behind different learning spaces and the incoherences and tensions of different ontics.

Analysis aims to focus on the use of evidence-based practice (EBP) as a justification in the process of policy creation. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed methodological approach was used to gather data, incorporating semi-structured interviews, documents, and descriptive statistics. Actor-network theory (ANT) was used as a critical lens to frame analysis. Findings: The study finds that the translation from local pilot to national initiative was achieved using legitimising discourses including EBP. These discourses were used selectively, and in response to the needs of the focal actors in the network. The complex relationship between EBP and self-help bibliotherapy is explored in connection with healthcare policy, concluding that the use of EBP legitimises a lack of patient-centred evaluation. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of the research include a lack of engagement with patients using the scheme, and future research should aim to present a more patient-centred account to complement this policy-focused work. Originality/value: Little in-depth work has been conducted on the strategy behind the introduction of bibliotherapy schemes in the UK or elsewhere, and this paper presents an in-depth theoretical analysis of the first nationwide bibliotherapy scheme in the world.

By practice-research networks we mean groups or networks which maintain a connection between research and professional practice. These networks stem from the philosophy of practitioner and action research in education. We use two examples both from higher and further education in England where continuing professional development has become a mandatory requirement for teachers in the Further Education (FE) sector. Our examples suggest that critical professional development can occur and although we are able to begin to identify some of the ways that these networks operate it is less clear which appropriate theories should support our work. The second part of the paper therefore explores some theoretical perspectives that focus on networks operating as systems. We discuss Actor Network Theory and Activity Theory which show how networks are populated by individuals with agency and suggest that a helpful way to contextualise the benefits of networks is provided by the concept of expansive learning providing a different understanding of how professional learning and development take place.

The purpose of this paper is to extend that enquiry by examining two professional groups in the UK - doctors and veterinarians. Design/methodology/approach: The paper examines a selection of social interactions, tensions and disagreements between practitioners and non-medical actors and draws on a range of qualitative research methods, particularly structured interview and participant observation, to analyse and interpret these as ""epistemological conflicts"". Findings: Hospital doctors and veterinary surgeons share a common belief that ""truth"" and ""facts"" are at the core of their clinical and surgical work. This positivist paradigm underpins a range of practical engagements with bodies and diseases and lends them a sense of ontological security when dealing with people from outside their professions, especially those without medical training. This paper examines the practical effects that such ontological tensions can have. In exposing some of these effects, this paper questions the often taken-for-granted divisions between science and arts, religion and medicine, and takes a more heterdox approach in analyzing social interactions. Originality/value: The paper advocates philosophical, methodological and theoretical heterodoxy. The findings are viewed through a number of different theoretical lenses; from actor network theory and sociology of technology and science (STS) to deconstruction, frame theory and semiotics. The paper makes no attempt to choose between these approaches and instead argues that a ""messy"" and multiple understanding, both of theory and practice, is needed to gain insights into the tricky politics of knowledge and its effects in practical settings.

Drawing on biopolitical and spatial theory, I trace how safe space is made, maintained, and unmade and ask what the role of cougars has been in production of spaces and their imagined security. Discussion is informed foremost by stories of cougar-human encounters on Vancouver Island and then retold based on newspaper and archival research and semistructured interviews with island residents. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how nonhumans matter to the material-semiotic construction of safety and space. In particular, I examine attempts to discipline cougars in the name of biosecurity, how cougars discipline humans, and how cougars' bodies and behaviors have resisted and shaped spatial configurations. I argue that these contestations and enforcements are biopolitical. My empiri-cal research supports recent theoretical arguments by geographers and actor-network theorists regarding space-namely, that space is produced within network formations of which cougars, in this case, are key actors. My analyses suggest that the biothreat cougars and humans pose to each other precludes the formation of ethics through encounter and that conservation strategies must account for cougars' spatial requirements.

Indeed, with its emphasis on the power of social and natural concrete 'things' to become contingently enrolled in different networks, many argue that ANT successfully draws attention to the complex intermeshing of new technologies and social actors in organizations and markets across spatial divides from the local to the global. This article argues, however, that within its own method of abstraction and research methodology, ANT separates 'concrete' and 'contingent' economic markets and organizations from their abstract, necessary and virtual capitalist form. This means that ANT will tend to over-identify with how concrete-contingent actor-networks are performed in empirical economic markets and organizations at the expense of analysing how such empirical contexts are also internally mediated through abstract capitalist processes such as that of surplus value extraction. This, in turn, creates a number of difficulties in how ANT investigates economic markets and organizations. These critical points are made by recourse to the Marxist poststructuralism of Deleuze and Guattari as well as through conventional Marxist ideas.

This article examines the significance of 'more than human' dimensions for this learning, using resources provided by actor-network theory (ANT). Drawing on data collected as part of a national study of practices of teacher professional learning and professional teaching standards, it is argued that teacher professional learning can, with profit, be conceptualised as a performative knowledge practice constituted and enacted by people and tools in complex collectives. In this conceptualisation, attention is given not only to what professional learning is but also to what it does - the effects it creates. Challenging the established individualised, psychological perspective, where learning is primarily seen in terms of the intrinsic capabilities or potentialities of people, ANT renders recognition of the constitutive roles of sociality and materiality in learning; the agency of both. Thinking performatively - seeing the human and the non-human at once - invites the dissolution of dichotomies such as professional knowing (education) and doing (work) and suspension of the means-ends production model of professional preparation. It also provides for the possibility of making visible, and attending to, forms of power that may otherwise go unrecognised.

This theoretic-methodological article shows how network processes can be conceptualized, and how the narrative approach advances the empirical study of these processes. The study builds an agency-structure meta-framework that conceptualizes the emergence of network processes in terms of interaction between individuals from different network actor organizations. The narrative research approach is put forward to implement the study of network processes into empirical reality. The narrative approach allows capturing the relevant actors, their multiple motives, interests and activities, and the mutual interplay of these elements with the contextual levels, thus providing an essential understanding of various types of network processes.

Although sociology of sport has drawn attention to a variety of facets of sports science, there has been only little attention to the enrolment processes through which sports scientists become part of the sporting network. This study uses a perspective specifically developed by actor network theorists for the study of mobilization and enrolment: the ""sociology of translation"" (Callon). The results demonstrate how this perspective reveals the power relations within the gymnastics network and how a variety of different actors, including individuals like gymnasts and coaches, and organizations, such as the government, can determine how enrolment processes operate.

In this article four examples are presented of how adulthood is constructed within the specific context of childhood research. Taking the departure in Deleuzian and actor network theories, four examples are given of subjectivites that emerge in specific events, where humans as well as non-humans are active agents: the 'adult-in-charge', the 'adult-included-in-commonality', the 'incompetent child' and the 'adult-as-other'. It is argued that there are always the possibilities of, on the one hand, performing the expected acts and, on the other hand, escaping from a stable and restricted adult subjectivity.

Such a perspective is deemed relational insofar as it keeps technology, society, language and the literate subject on the same ontological plane, and emphasizes the tools and processes of circulation and mediation between what, from another viewpoint, might be called the local and the global/universal. Using concepts and insights from Actor-Network Theory, the study produced and compared two cases in which informants were taken as the central entrepreneurs of literacy networks. Empirical strategies for the generation of data included (i) keeping records of the informants' online activities produced by specialized software (ii) participant and non-participant observation of literacy events and practices in which the informants were involved, and (iii) semi-structured interviews before, during, and after (i) and (ii). The data was then used to describe, through the lens of Actor-Network Theory, how the informants related to their various literacies. The findings include the identification of a set of boundary objects and boundary practices which allowed informants to productively connect literacies distributed in different institutional, spatiotemporal and thematic contexts to a more global enterprise defined as the production of their own subjectivities. Such findings are discussed in the light of current research efforts geared towards the development of a post-social approach to literacy studies.

Spain's Cidade da Cultura, a museum conceptualized by Galicia's former president with the hubristic goal of creating a world icon, is one such example. Like many iconic constructions, the Cidade da Cultura project was highly contentious and sparked a regionwide political debate, vastly overran its projected cost, and years later remains controversial and incomplete. An actor-network theory analysis of why the project failed reveals the different roles played by individual components in the vast network of actors, including the monument itself, which came to exercise influence over the outcome of the project. Because the former president could not fully control this expanding network of actors, events soon spun out of control in what became popularly known as ""Galicia's Hurricane"".

We calculate the best rate of dispatching of tasks by the network sink to allocated actors through a steady state analysis of our proposed model to solve equations and inequalities. We show that this dispatching rate reduces the overall completion time of all tasks in the network too. Experimental results on typical scenarios have shown 53% improvement in reducing the number of waiting tasks and 40% improvement in reducing the network makespan compared to stochastic allocation of tasks to actors. We also show that this makespan improvement results in more power savings in actors.

The order emerged within a narrative from the reconstruction of sequences of events can be taken as evidence of the causal relations between specified aspects of reality. This evidentiary status of causality attributed to narratives may be taken for granted when using actor-network theory (ANT) as a methodology, because ANT descriptions and explanations cannot be separated. This article suggests that the use of ANT benefits from merging CALLON's processes of translation and event structure analysis (ESA). Proposed is an approach for merging the two, which provides an interpretation of main ESA concepts in ANT terms. This article describes the application of this approach in a case study, and argues that the conceptual tools offered by ANT and ESA tap into the potential of narratives to be simultaneously descriptive and explanatory by fostering an explicit deployment of temporal order, connectedness, and unfolding of events.

We also synthesize historical and current evidence to map out 2 possible scenarios for the future. In the first scenario, prevention efforts emphasize primary care and focus almost entirely downstream.

This paper reports on preliminary findings of a multi-method PhD study which examines the digital literacy practices arising when an adult learner in a UK college completes writing assignments for her course. It explores whether she uses digital tools agentively and decisively in her personal life, in order to transform her classroom practice. Data show that mobilising personal digital literacy practices into classroom-based literacy events allows learners to successfully make the link between their own everyday digital literacy practices and the requirements of their course. It is argued that a ""social practice"" approach to digital literacies, along with actor-network theory sensibilities, allows researchers to observe the sensitivity of classroom-based digital literacy events to the layered multiplicity of their contexts.

By drawing on activity theory to conceptualize learning with technology and Actor-Network theory to understand the relationships between materials and humans, the use of educational technology in two secondary school mathematics classrooms is investigated. Drawing on interviews and video-recorded classroom observation, this investigation maps the patterns of relations among humans and materials as classroom socio-technical networks adapt to the inclusion of a handheld digital technology. The results present a variety of ways that the human and material actors in classroom socio-technical networks operate as an interconnected whole rather than as a set of individual interactions.

Following the reinterpretation of a painted statue into a white museum artefact, I argue that the rules we have to follow in approaching an artefact create a series of unrelated socio-cultural connotations which shape our perception of the object. The culture of the artefact is therefore largely the culture of the context through which it is presented. Hence, by distancing an artefact from an established context you also distance it from the networks that make up a large part of its cultural value. To discuss this process I draw on the works of Michael Callon and Bruno Latour, describing the presentation as a translation - a process where the artefact is reinterpreted from one state into another. As a method to describe values sprung from the presentation of the artefact, I propose, and exemplify, a vocabulary of limitations for mapping the ties between society and artefact in different contexts.

Drawing on a survey of ongoing initiatives at national level and on evidence from empirical fieldwork in a specific territorial context showing a variegated and dynamic reality at this regard (Tuscany), the article analyses consumers' evolving attitudes and behaviour, around and even beyond food, unfolding during their involvement in these initiatives. In particular, it focuses on the experience of the solidarity-based purchasing groups, consumers' organisations promoted by groups of citizens aiming at getting control of the food they consume. Using an actor-network perspective, the article analyses how purchasing and consumption routines change when consumers join these initiatives. The article also discusss the potential of these initiatives as drivers of change along with the following questions: to what extent do these initiatives challenge dominant food practices and system governance? On what basis are these initiatives sustainable and are replicable in different contexts? How can they foster other forms of civic engagement? In this regard, the article tests a transition management approach, considering solidarity-based purchasing groups as socio-technical niches within broader socio-technical regimes in a macro landscape characterised by the globalisation of the food system. In particular, it analyses the critical points where niches enter in conflict with existing socio-technical regimes, and the way in which these groups act to remove legal, technological and cultural barriers to their development.

To make this argument, the article presents data from a case study of a technical communicator at a software firm, showing how a reminder note he carried to a meeting helped him achieve an important design change. The article unpacks the concept of immutable mobiles from actor network theory to derive a framework that helps us interpret the multiple functions of this note in helping the technical communicator warrant and win a design argument with software developers.

The object of analysis is Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and it is based on the Actor-Network Theory and asociology, which define social phenomena as a network of translational intermediaries. The author is primarily interested in the practice, institutions and actors who contributed to shaping and maintaining the image of ADHD as a congenital, chronic and hereditary disease. He shows how these definitions are embodied in practices, institutions, law and politics. In addition to the hybridity and heterogeneity of ADHD, the study also aims to present the major controversies surrounding the diagnosis, treatment and etiology of the disorder.","ADHD; ANT; Asociology; Controversies; Disorder; Health; Hybrid",,,,,,,"Abriszewski, K., (2008) Poznanie, ZbiorowoÅÄ, Polityka.

However, little critical attention is paid to the behavioural aspects in a design process. Specifically, the role of the actors, group dynamics, consensus building and how results are achieved. This paper describes a design-oriented case study on the content development of the Enterprise Architecture Management, one of 32 critical processes (CP) of the Information Technology Capability Maturity Framework (IT-CMF). The case study methodology is an ethnographic exploratory approach tracing the content development of this CP from conception to maturity. We apply the combined principles of design science and Actor Network Theory (ANT). We develop a Translation Model that gives an integrative basis for using these combined principles in order to interpret the content development of this CP. The paper concludes with the validation of the Translation Model model to highlight its dominating qualities.","Actor network theory; Design science; Enterprise architecture management; Information technology capability maturity framework; Translation model","Actor network theory; Behavioural aspects; Behavioural science; Content development; Design process; Design science; Enterprise architecture managements; Group dynamics; Principles of design; Translation models; Industry; Information systems; Information theory; Product design; Behavioral research",,,,,,"Benbasat, I., Zmud, R.W., Empirical research in information systems: The practice of relevance (1999) MIS Quarterly, 23 (1), pp. 3-16; Braganza, A., Hackney, R., Tanudjojo, S., Organizational knowledge transfer through creation, mobilization and diffusion: A case analysis of InTouch within schlumberger (2009) Information Systems Journal, 19, pp. 499-522; Bruner, E.M., Introduction: The ethnographic self and the personal self (1993) Anthropology and Literature, pp. 1-26. , P.

The strategy here is to present multiple readings of the two examples. The first reading adopts an ANT approach to follow ways that all actors-human and non-human entities, including the entity that is taken to be 'educational reform'-are performed into being through the play of linkages among heterogeneous elements. Then, further readings focus not only on the material practices that become enacted and distributed, but also on the otherings that occur: the various fluid spaces and ambivalent belongings that create actor-network(s) but also escape them. For educational research, particularly in educational reform and policy, it is argued that ANT analyses are particularly useful to examine the complex enactments in these dynamics. That is, ANT can illuminate movements of ordering and disordering that occur through minute socio-material connections in educational interventions. ANT readings also can discern, within these attempts to order people and practices, the spaces of flux and instability that enable and protect alternate possibilities. Â© 2010 The Author.

What is the value of the concept of 'affordances'? And how does research articulating this concept act to position mobile devices as 'technologies for learning'? This literature review used both unstructured and structured search samples of published research on mobile learning to critically evaluate the prevalence and influence of the concept of the affordances of mobile technologies. Actor-network theory is drawn on as a theoretical lens through which to critically consider how this concept is articulated, and in particular to explore the way it positions and controls mobile devices as technologies for learning. Parallels in contemporary accounts of mobile learning are drawn with classifications of previous discourses around the introduction of computers into schools. An alternative agenda for mobile learning research is suggested with a focus on authentic and informal contexts rather than controlled experiments.

The study employs a case study approach drawing on actor network theory (ANT) to chart the building, disintegration, and rebuilding of the network. This evolution can be understood based on the convergence between different actors through coordination and alignment. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of ANT's concepts in analyzing an e- Government project and how a technical design underwent transformation to reach network stability through interrelations of actors and convergence among them. The findings include the factors that contribute to the adaptability of the system design by all the actors.

Recent advances in the development of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with built in sensors made it possible to deploy aerial sensor and actor networks. An aerial network composed of small UAVs enables high quality observation for events while reducing the number of personnel and the risk for the operators. In order to have an effective data collection, the positioning of actors plays a critical role in aerial WSANs. In this paper we propose an actor positioning strategy for aerial WSANs considering the scenario of toxic plume observation after a volcanic eruption, which is one of the emerging applications of aerial UAV networks. Measuring the composition of volcanic plumes allows the computation of volcanogenic fluxes and provides insights into volatile degassing mechanisms. The actors in the proposed approach use a lightweight and distributed algorithm to form a self organizing network around the central UAV, which has the role of the sink in the WSAN.

The paper explores how device construction instigated by middle-level organizational workers can ramify into organizational change, and extends Actor Network theory by augmenting some of its conceptual tools. I argue that the organizational change processes initiated by work on the devices played out in non-linear ways across the decades-long careers of their makers, and that to understand them we not only have to look across such extended time frames, but must also consider how agency and identity positions emerge and shift over time through the mediation of devices.

In order to address this research need, our study examines how Environmental Non-Governmental Organisations (ENGOs) in two developing countries use collaborative technologies to co-ordinate and collaborate with diverse and distributed stakeholders towards achieving shared environmental goals. This paper explores how collaborative technologies can transform eco-collaborative efforts and influence the achievement of environmental objectives. Our investigation is viewed from an Actor-Network Theory (ANT) perspective which reveals the emerging roles and limitations of collaborative technologies as mediators of eco-collaboration in Thailand and Lebanon.

Accident surveys in aviation have attributed 70% of incidents to crew error citing pilot error as the root cause of an aviation accident (Woods et al., 1994: 2). Through an analysis facilitated by Actor Network Theory (ANT), the 'black box' of pilot error is examined revealing a de-centered accident aetiology residing within a network of heterogeneous elements characterized as the 'hybrid collectif ' (Callon and Law, 1995). The actor network theory worldview provides a mechanism that reveals a rich, contextual mapping of the socio-technical relations that reside within the network space.

Environmental collaboration is a complex phenomenon involving a multitude of stakeholders and resources often dispersed across vast geographically, politically and culturally diverse areas. The study contextualises the environmental problem situation in Australia and Thailand, and considers the multifaceted emergence of environmental collaboration enacted by various local Environmental Non- Governmental Organisations (ENGO). A research approach, based on the Actor-Network Theory (ANT) is adopted. By retracing the associations and the complex webs of translations taking place in the environmental actor-networks of diverse stakeholders and collaborative technologies, the study reveals the emerging roles and limitations of collaborative technologies as mediators of eco-mobilisation.

This paper aims at analyzing risks management of GM crops technology in China, such as risk classification, risk generating mechanisms and its governance. Drawing on both general situation of GM crops technology and extensive academic research concerning its safety, we seek to create a three-dimensional model capable of analyzing the extent of harm associated with GM crops technology risks. On the basis of this framework, the risk of GM crops technology can be divided into eight types, depending on the high or low risks levels associated with social harm, technology maturity and economic outcomes. The paper shows that China is currently located in the high risk zone of this model, where the high technological uncertainty associated with the high potential for social harm shows the urgency for better governance. In order to tackle this, the article introduces the Actor-Network Theory (ANT) as a useful tool to explore the risk assessment and governance of GM crops technology in China. It reveals that the Chinese Government is situated in Obligatory Passage Point (OPP) which is the cardinal node in the network. Its administrative sections play different roles by their respective status in the stages of introducing, creating interest, participating in development and overall support for any new technology. Hence in the case of GM technology, the Chinese government can construct an efficient governance mechanism which should be able to balance actors' interests and reduce or avoid risks induced by GM crops technology in China.","Actor-network theory; Genetically modified; GM food; Risk management; Three-dimension model","Academic research; Actor network theory; Agricultural sector; Chinese Government; General situation; Generating mechanism; Genetically engineered crops; Genetically modified; Genetically modified food; GM crops; GM technology; High potential; High-risk zones; Risk classification; Risks management; Technological uncertainty; Technology maturity; Technology risks; Three-dimension; Three-dimensional model; Food technology; Genetic engineering; Genetically modified plants; Risk management; Social sciences computing; Technology; Three dimensional; Risk assessment",,,,,,"Callon, M., Law, J., Rip, A., (1986) Mapping the Dynamics of Science and Technology: Sociology of Science in the Real World, , Macmillan, Houndmills, UK; Chen, J., Status quo of GM crops' commercialization and their impacts on crops security and future lessons (2010) Issues in Agricultural Economy, 31 (2), pp. 15-20; Harhoff, D., RÃ©gibeau, P., Rockett, K., Some simple economics of GM food (2001) Economic Policy, 16 (10), pp. 263-299; Hou, S., Gu, H., Management of GM food labeling and consumers' consent and selection rights (2005) Studies in Science of Science, 23 (4), pp. 461-466; Hong, J., Yu, W., Wang, K., China's biopharmaceutical industry's evolution and governance of technology based on actor-network theory (2010) Forum on Science and Technology in China, 26 (11), pp. 55-61; Huang, J., Jiu, H., Bai, J., Pray, C., China's urban consumers' awareness and acceptance level of GM food and their willingness to buy (2006) China Soft Science, 21 (2), pp. 61-67; Global Status of Commercialized Biotech/GM Crops: 2009, the First Fourteen Years, 1996 to 2009.

PISA attempts to provide efficient, scientific and technical means to develop educational policies which achieve optimal outcomes (Berg & Timmermans, 2000, p. 31). This kind of scientific evidence is seen by policy makers as being free of prejudice and ideology. Science is expected to represent the truth, state universal facts and make predictions. Thus PISA seeks to rank countries' performances, work out future scenarios and offer policy direction. By what means does PISA gain knowledge and speak with confidence about diverse cultures and distant nations? How does it acquire a 'voice from nowhere' (Haraway, 1988; Suchman, 2000), and become a modern-day Oracle that countries might consult for policy advice? Modelled on early actor-network accounts of laboratory life, this ethnography traces how PISA knowledge comes to be made, guided by interview data with two 'insiders' in the 'PISA laboratory'. It traces the translations and the circulating reference that turn PISA into a 'centre of calculation'. It highlights how human and non-human entities are imbricated in the assembling of scientific facts and argues for a suspension of the divide between 'science' and 'politics'. In the process, the paper offers an empirical instantiation of how some concepts from actor-network theory may be applied in the field of education policy, and ponders the implications of such an understanding for evidence based policy making.

The paper will compare four projects launched in the mid-1990s and policymakers' visions of healthcare through telemedicine. I will employ a sociotechnical approach developed within Actor-Network Theory that understands functioning technology not as something intrinsic but as an outcome of an ongoing process of negotiations. In the paper, I will extend the sociotechnical approach of what constitutes working technology to include spatiotemporal matters. I will also approach the closely related issue of space that has become a concern of Actor-Network Theory scholars interested in the accomplishment and continued workings of technology as it travels. In this discussion, an emphasis on fixed relations (network space) has been challenged by investigations into changing relations (fluid space).

This thesis presents new perspectives opened by actor-network theory for policy analysis and policy making. The main idea is that managing complexity and uncertainty involves recognizing and dealing with multiple and hybrid realities. Drawing on inputs from Actor-Network Theory (ANT), the city is explored as a multiple urban assemblage. ANT allows thinking the city as a heterogeneous and decentred object. The notion of urban assemblages is introduced to account for the multiple and hybrid nature of the city. Besides, the dichotomous nature of the modern notion of politics is analyzed. Finally, through the analysis of substantive consequences of citizen participation in urban policies a new hybrid notion of citizen participation and policy processes is proposed.","Actor-network theory; Hybrid relationality; Policy analysis; Public action; Urban assemblages",,,,,,,"Grau, M., ÃÃ±iguez-Rueda, L., Subirats, J., La Perspectiva sociotÃ©cnica en el anÃ¡lisis de polÃ­ticas pÃºblicas (2010) PsicologÃ­a PolÃ­tica, 41, pp. 61-80; Grau-SolÃ©s, M., ÃÃ±iguez-Rueda, L., Subirats, J., Una perspectiva hÃ­brida y nomoderna para los estudios urbanos Athenea Digital, , (en premsa); Grau-SolÃ©s, M., ÃÃ±iguez-Rueda, L., Subirats, J., Â¿CÃ³mo gobernar la complejidad?

Our experiences are taking from an innovation and research project about user-involvement in textile design processes. As the project focused on textiles role in healing hospital environments, the co-design process analyzed is a process of designing textile products for these environments. During the co-design process we engaged architects, engineers and textile designers. The focus in this paper is specifically on the challenges related to translating and transporting the results of these different events due to the institutional and professional framing of projects and design processes. We are analyzing these through an actor network approach and use the translation term to describe how the participants slowly became engaged in our project's agenda by going through the different stages of translation.

The purpose of this article is to introduce to information science in a coherent fashion the core premises of contemporary practice theory, and thus to engage the information research community in further debate and discussion. Method. Contemporary practice-based approaches are summarised in an ensemble of five core premises by means of a broad conceptual analysis of the relevant literature. Differentiated from its historical antecedents by central ideas from science and technology studies, particularly actor-network theory and the sociology of translation, this current practice movement builds on the latest practice 'turn' which is then used to answer the question of how practice theory could contribute to information science. Results. Capturing the distinct ontology, epistemology and methodology of current practice theory, the five key premises provide novel insights in transcending the macro-objectivist and micro-subjectivist levels of analysis, in sociomateriality, in stretching interactions to action nets to conceptualize dynamic organizing, in the sharing of tacit knowledge, in the emergent nature of knowing and learning, and in social order and change as dynamic outcomes of the tightly interwoven processes of doing, knowing and organizing. Conclusions This article distinguishes the everyday notion of practice, mostly understood as practices, from contemporary practice theory which aspires to integrate practice ontology, epistemology and methodology into a coherent theoretical framework. This upcoming theory offers a dedicated vocabulary and approach to all of those information scientists who either focus on macro-structures or micro-interactions in their studies, but feel at risk of ignoring or missing important dimensions of social order and change in action.

Diabetes is one of the leading chronic diseases and its prevalence continues to rise exponentially. Thus it behooves all to focus on solutions that can result in superior management of this disease. Hence, the following presents findings from a longitudinal exploratory case study that examined the application of a pervasive technology solution; a mobile phone, to provide superior diabetes self-care. The conclusions highlight the benefits of a pervasive technology solution for supporting superior self-care in the context of chronic disease. Moreover, it is proffered that by employing the theories of Actor Network and Social Network Analysis the full benefits of this technology enabled solution can be identified.","Actor network theory; Chronic disease; Healthcare; Pervasive wireless solution; Social network analysis","Actor Network Theory; Actor-network; Chronic disease; Chronic disease management; Health care costs; Health issues; Mobile solutions; Pervasive technologies; Pervasive wireless solution; Self-care; Social Network Analysis; Health care; Information systems; Information theory; Medical computing; Research; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Diseases",,,,,,"(2007) National Indicators for Monitoring Diabetes: Report of the Diabetes Indicators Review Subcommittee of the National Diabetes Data Working, , AIHW; (2008) Diabetes: Australian Facts 2008, , AIHW, Canberra: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare; Bigum, C., Solutions in search of educational Problems: Speaking for computers in schools (1998) Educational Policy, 12 (5), pp. 586-596; Boyatzis, R., (1998) Transforming Qualitative Information Thematic Analysis and Code Development, , Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks; Britt, H., Miller, G.C., Charles, J., Pan, Y., Valenti, L., Henderson, J., Bayram, C., Knox, S., (2007) General Practice Activity in Australia 2005-06, , Cat. no.

The focus is on outlining the theoretical framework in which this study is embedded. The concepts of cumulative network effects and segmentive network effects are introduced to explain the processes by which social media can generate and maintain both a larger network of members (an online city) and a more personalized space within that larger network (an online neighborhood). Taking an actor network approach, it is theorized that cumulative and segmentive network effects are generated by unique assemblages of humans and objects engaged in meaningful epistemic relationships. This study contributes to theory by considering how the two network effects can be simultaneously fostered on the same platform and by taking technology into account as an active actor in online human activities.","Actor network theory; Network effects; Online cities and neighborhoods; Social media","Actor network theory; Actor-network; Human activities; Larger networks; Network effects; Online cities and neighborhoods; Social media; Theoretical framework; Information systems; Social networking (online); Economic and social effects",,,,,,"Asvanund, A., Clay, K., Krishnan, R., Smith, M., An empirical analysis of network externalities in peer-to-peer music-sharing networks (2004) Information Systems Research, 15 (2), pp. 155-174; Boyd, D., Ellison, N., Social networking sites: Definition, history and scholarship (2008) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13, pp. 210-230; Butler, B., Membership size, communication activity, and sustainability: A resource-based model of online social structures (2004) Information Systems Research, 12 (4), pp. 346-362; Cordella, A., Shaikh, M., (2006) From Epistemology to Ontology: Challenging the Constructed ""truth"" of ANT, , http://www.is2.lse.ac.uk/WP/PDF/wp143.pdf, London School of Economics and Political Science, Department of Information Systems, Working Paper Series.

The paper explores the contrasting ways in which the prescribed curriculum is translated into the enacted curriculum as certain organisations, individuals and artefacts become enrolled through networks of school and college. It points to the ways in which a position which eschews conventional distinctions e.g. between the human and non-human, and enacts an anti-foundationalist ontology provides the basis for a radical materialist understanding of the multiplicity of educational practices.

It contrasts two idioms for thinking about and studying these standards, the representational and the performative. Utilising the material-semiotic approach of actor-network theory, it addresses the issue of how the representational idiom of teaching standards has become so authoritative that it readily eclipses other ways to think and 'do' them. In tracing the development of a specific set of teaching standards as part of a national research project, the argument is made that standards should be understood as performative knowledge and identity practices. And, accounting them should also be performative. Accordingly, attention is given to key locales in which this development is taking place. Teaching standards emerge as ontologically variable and it is struggles around this variability that can create conditions for a renewed practice and politics of education reform. Â© 2010 The Author.

It introduces the key features of a recent educational policy reform initiative, Skills for Life and illustrates the argument by looking at three 'moments' (in Callon's 1986 terminology) in the life of this initiative, applying the theoretical tools of ANT to these. The analysis shows that even (and perhaps especially) within a strongly framed social policy initiative like the Skills for Life Strategy, things constantly escape; that differences held in tension within the 'successful' project sow the seeds of failure and dissolution.

The players were engaged in a high-stakes collaborative activity called raiding in the massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) World of Warcraft (WoW). They met twice a week for a 10-month period to defeat common game-controlled monsters. The add-on's use complicates the notion that tools are necessarily used in a way they were designed to be used. Instead, ""in the wild"" practice emerges out of the push-pull relationship of competing parties and objects.

In this article we explore neglected countervailing trends, such as quarantines, health inspections, and import bans, where science has the effect of restricting mobility, which we refer to as ""slow science."" As well as increasing mobility, science can be mobilized for political projects of restricting movement, but this possibility is neglected because of cultural assumptions fundamental to modernity. Both science and technology can be enrolled for projects of slowing mobility as well as increasing mobility. Drawing on actor-network theory, we examine the enrolment of science and technology into restricting movement in various ways. These issues are explored first through an overview of the neglected genealogy of the ways in which science and technology have slowed movement, particularly across national borders, and second through a short case study of how food safety concerns affect the movement of beef across borders. The case study discusses how ""slow science"" diagnoses threats posed by mobility and develops technologies to immobilize certain entities. These entities have almost always been biological organisms (including humans) or their products due to the self-reproducing qualities of invasive species, bacteria, or viruses. Uniquely, WTO rules about food require that restrictions be based on sound science, resulting in trade disputes focused on scientific interpretations.

The area of drug policy change presents an excellent example for discussing the problem and the process of coalition building for finding acceptable answers to new challenges. Modern sociological theory has developed concepts and tools for a description and analysis of such processes. Some concrete case studies from Swiss cities are available as a basis for advanced discussion of theoretical concepts. The observational description of the coalition building in the city of Zurich helps to illustrate the inherent elements, problems and outcomes; a more detailed process analysis focuses on the initial phases and further development of the various formal and informal coalitions, introducing the importance of shared objectives for action and the need for concerted activities. A clear policy concept and a consistent action plan were not available at first, but they proved to be an important step in the consolidation of what was a non-systematic beginning. What started at local level and led to a new national policy was not so much a continued clash between two ideologies - harm reduction versus strict prohibition -, but was the beginning of a new thinking about how the various policy elements could successfully work together in the pursuit of a shared concrete objective. These observations may be considered in further theory development and policy considerations.","Actor network theory; Case study; Coalition building; Societal learning; Urban drug policy",,,,,,,"Callon, M., Lascoumes, P., Barthe, Y., (2009) Acting in an Uncertain World.

At the same time, the use of new technology in schools is said to challenge authority. How is authority produced and maintained in classrooms not just through engagement among humans, but also through engagements between humans and non-human elements? In a computer-enhanced primary school classroom where the construction-based learning platform Lego Robolab is used, authority is achieved in a close coordination of humans and materials. Authorisations are made available through socio-material coordination: authority is generated as an ongoing interactive process through which social as well as material participants grant each other authority. Authority is achieved though a simultaneously fragile and extensively entangled circulation of authorisations among children, teachers and Lego Robolab. However, the presence of these particular actors is not a sufficient condition for authority to emerge. Emotions are important in bringing these actors together: expectations, trust and interest activate circulations of authorisations. Moreover, authority is not granted once and for all. Authorisations circulate in the classroom, handing over authority from one participant to the next. Rather a stable human possession, authority can be conceptualised as a processual and socio-material phenomenon, while also involving emotions and inter-personal relations.

While the adoption of new immaterial technologies promises to improve the ease with which birding is practiced, their use leads to new ethical considerations. Using the Internet to share bird sightings, for example, lowers the barrier of entry to access this information. Therefore, bird sightings proliferate, often with little thought to the consequences of birders visiting the reported birds' location. A digital image, captured by digital cameras, perhaps marks the greatest change. With the adoption of a digital camera the nature of identification is effectively changed: captured images remove birds from the field and their broader ecological context. Given that birding is proposed as a way for western culture to reconnect with the more-than-human world, these digital objects promise to redefine a relationship with birds and the larger natural world.

Employing actor network theory to inform an ethnographic-inductive approach, the case study sought to understand the performative effects of technologies on the creation of forms of learning and forms of presence in a setting of peer-based learning. The research data included observation of discussions in an online forum and chats, course participants' blogs and P2PU's organisational documentation. Three main findings emerged from a thematic analysis: (1) the participatory role of technology in the course was characterised by the use of an array of different open source and free tools, most of which were not integrated within the P2PU platform - and this fluid technological space arguably led to a decentralised network; (2) people with different backgrounds affiliated around their common passion for the cyberpunk literature and the artefacts associated with it; and (3) knowledge was distributed and dispersed across many different people and artefacts, bringing about a shift from the subject-authority pattern of relations generally associated with teacher-led education to the agential pattern of relations associated with peer-led education, in which the course organiser and participants can have the same level of influence.",,,,,,,,"Batson, T., Paharia, N., Kumar Vijay, M.S., A Harvest too Large?

It reveals the degree and kinds of school dysfunctions, as well as their interconnectedness with actors, networks, and domains. The model provides a basis for theory-based analyses of specific dysfunctions, and for context and culture-sensitive interventions. The main dysfunctions relate to rules (dysfunctional rules, rule bending, and rule breaking), competences (management, finances, and conflict resolution), and roles (role confusion and conflict, abuse of power). The model was developed to invite researchers to explore these and other dysfunctions in relation to their antecedents, motivations, and consequences, as well as to formulate evidence-based interventions and policies.

Actor-network theory is used to show how the phases of problematisation, interessement, enrolment and mobilisation are negotiated by the primum movens (training provider) to establish a mobile post-training support network. This paper concludes by extracting valuable pointers from the narrative towards the establishment of a well-functioning mobile post-training support network in a developing context. It shows that the establishment of a strong actor-network during training is crucial for establishing a successful mobile post-training support network.

The paper describes an explorative study of the diffusion of domotics technologies in residential construction. Design/methodology/approach Innovation systems theory, which points to the ""technological regime"" in the actor network as a key element in the diffusion, acceptance, and application of new technologies was used to analyse the diffusion of domotics technologies in residential construction. Findings The results underscored the expected "" bottlenecks"" in the technological regime of the innovation system that curtailed the diffusion of domotics technologies in construction. Originality/value The novelty of the paper is in the approach of the research and the collected data on the technological regime amongst the stakeholders. These stakeholders were principally involved in development and implementation of the domotics technologies in residential construction; these observations provided useful insights into the diffusion of domotics technologies.

In this discussion, Tara Fenwick and Richard Edwards argue for a greater focus on materiality in educational policy as a way to trace the heterogeneous interactions and precarious linkages that enact policy as complex manifestations. In particular, Fenwick and Edwards point to the methodologies of actor-network theory (ANT), at least in its most recent permutations, as a useful approach to materiality in policy analysis. Published examples of educational policy studies drawing from these methodologies are beginning to appear. In reviewing these, we argue that ANT sensibilities help to make visible the sociomaterial assemblages-the ""messy objects""-that enact policy, the micro-negotiations that mobilize and stabilize (and destabilize) these assemblages, and the multiple ontologies that often coexist in policy environments. Fenwick and Edwards conclude with a discussion of methodological issues for working with concepts of ontological variance and messy objects in educational policy.

The results reveal that managerial ties relate to open innovation, while non-significant findings are found with the other two hypotheses. Social Exchange and Actor-Network theories are used to explain the framework of this study. Limitations, practical and academic implications are discussed.","Malaysia; Managerial ties; Open innovation; Organizational citizenship behaviours",,,,,,,"Acha, V., Cusmano, L., Governance and co-ordination of distributed innovation processes: Patterns of R&D co-operation in the upstream petroleum industry (2005) Economics of Innovation and New Technology, 14 (1-2), pp. 1-21; Adler, P.S., Kwon, S.W., Social capital: Prospects for a new concept (2002) The Academy of Management Review, 27 (1), pp. 17-40; Ãmo, B.W., (2005), Employee innovation behavior: HandelshÃ¸gskolen i BodÃ¸Anton, J., Yao, D., Little patents and big secrets: Managing intellectual property (2004) The RAND Journal of Economics, 35 (1), pp. 1-22; Archabal, D., Badgett, M., Chu, J., Kalyanam, K., Cross channel optimization (2005), Somers NY: IBM CorporationAtkins, M.H., The role of appropriability in sustaining competitive advantage--an electronic auction system case study (1998) The Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 7 (2), pp. 131-152. , doi: Doi: 10.1016/s0963- 8687(98)00019-5; Bateman, T.S., Organ, D.W., Job Satisfaction and the Good Soldier: The Relationship between Affect and Employee Citizenship (1983) The Academy of Management Journal, 26 (4), pp. 587-595; Bell, S.J., Menguc, B., The employee-organization relationship, organizational citizenship behaviors, and superior service quality (2002) Journal of Retailing, 78 (2), pp. 131-146; Brodbeck, P., Complexity theory and organization procedure design (2002) Business Process Management Journal, 8 (4), pp. 377-402; Chen, C.J., Huang, J.W., How organizational climate and structure affect knowledge management- -The social interaction perspective (2007) International Journal of Information Management, 27 (2), pp. 104-118. , doi: DOI: 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2006.11.001; Chesbrough, H., The era of open innovation (2003) MIT Sloan Management Review, p. 44; Chesbrough, H., (2003), Open Innovation.

The article argues that there is much to be gained for the logics approach in paying closer attention to the materiality of practices in terms not only of lending greater clarity to the conception and role of social practices in the logics approach but also in enabling it fully to deliver on its critical ambition. The article explores an alternative materialist approach to the study of social practices, which hails from the post-actor-network-theory tradition and which has ontological affinities with post-structuralism. The article begins with a brief analysis of the new materialist turn in its various guises. It then critically examines the logics approach, and, in particular its conception of practice. It then explores an alternative materialist and ethnographic reading of practice, focusing on medical and care practices. It concludes with an examination of the implications for a more materialist conception of practices for the LCE's broad deconstructive, psychoanalytic and onto-political ambitions.

The vision behind developing this technical standard was to create online courses as a jigsaw of independent 'off the shelf' pieces that could be found in a database and assembled as you please. Using a computer program, it would be possible to choose the desired materials and join them into a course. In this standardization process, the chief problem of online education was argued to be high production costs, so LOs were performed as a means to lower these costs by achieving economies of scale. Furthermore a technical method, modularization of LOs, was proposed as a means to achieve this aim. It was argued that modularization would be more efficient if course content was broken into 'packages' with small 'granularity'. The economic purpose was, as Actor-Network Theory would put it, translated into technological design. Additional translations put into play links between modularity/granularity and the treatment of LOs as 'atomic'. Atomic LOs were to be self-contained, non-sequential, and contextless digital objects. Lastly, in an extreme argument by one of the key proponents, LOs were performed as being the road to a new atomic science of education. By enacting Learning Objects in this manner, a specific materiality of learning was geared toward what I call 'epistemic atomism': the performance of knowledge as discrete and basic entities-as stable reference points which exist 'out there', beyond any social contextuality.

In the opinion of the author, the foundation disciplines of information systems raise two key questions related to this a) how to define, design, create and implement ICT resources in order to achieve the organizational objectives, and b) how can we explain that quite often even the best quality ICT resources are not able to achieve enhancement of organizational value. The first issue is an engineering type of dilemma, consisting of design, construction and project management; while the second is a typical social science problem entailing economics, organizational science and sociology. The author develops a series of arguments that in order to solve these dilemmas an extension of the traditional technology deterministic view is necessary in the Hungarian IS research and education community. The first such extension is the incorporation of Science Technology Studies (STS) especially with the areas of social construction of technology and actor-network theory (ANT). By integrating these into IS we will have a much better understanding of the effects and impediments of the presently so popular ubiquitios computing. The second extension, based on the best practices of US Ph.D. programs are the incorporation of Herbert Simon's theory of the sciences of the artificial which enable IS professionals to clearly appreciate the importance of design science and action research contributing to the actual construction and configuration of complex ICT and organizational resources.","Diffusion of innovations; Hype cycle; Mobile application; Mobile technology",,,,,,,"Aranyossy, M., Nemeslaki, A., InformÃ¡ciÃ³technolÃ³giai beruhÃ¡zÃ¡sok megtÃ©rÃ¼lÃ©sÃ©nek modellezÃ©se - problÃ©mÃ¡k Ã©s megoldÃ¡sok egy vÃ¡llalati portÃ¡l pÃ©ldÃ¡jÃ¡n (2005) VezetÃ©studomÃ¡ny, 36 (9), pp. 24-36; BarabÃ¡si, A.L., (2003) BehÃ¡lÃ³zva, , M.

Outbreaks of foodborne illness have received increasing attention in recent years, resulting in a growing awareness of the negative impacts associated with industrial food production. These trends indicate a need to examine systemic causes of outbreaks and how they are being addressed. In this paper, we analyze outbreaks linked to ground beef and salad greens. These case studies are informed by personal interviews, site visits, and an extensive review of government documents and peer-reviewed literature. To explore these cases, we draw from actor-network theory and political economy to analyze the relationships between technological tools, the design of industrial production systems, and the emergence and spread of pathogenic bacteria. We also examine if current responses to outbreaks represent reflexive change. Lastly, we use the myth of Prometheus to discuss ethical issues regarding the use of technology in food production. Our findings indicate that current tools and systems were designed with a narrow focus on economic efficiency, while overlooking relationships with pathogenic bacteria and negative social impacts. In addition, we find that current responses to outbreaks do not represent reflexive change and a continued reliance on technological fixes to systemic problems may result in greater problems in the future.

The debate is typically characterized by tendentious arguments as advocates of each approach offer a one-sided condemnation of other approaches. Debate on the qualities of theoretical explanations of technological change is hampered by the shadow of supremacist strategies that is cast over the debate, illustrating the manner in which IS researchers are polarized into opposing camps, each viewing the other as inferior. Ironically further polarization is occurring in the ways that various groups of IS scholars are simultaneously calling for order, discipline and clearer notions of the -core of the discipline"" while other scholars call for greater research diversity. In order to overcome this polarization we advocate a strategy recommended by Weick [1996]: Drop your tools-hold your concepts lightly and update them frequently. Three reasons for dropping our theoretical tools are put forward-the focus on improving practice, the focus on building cumulative tradition in the mother discipline, and the focus on building cumulative tradition in one's own discipline-suggesting researchers must consider the -fit"" between problem domain, theory and the relationship of the chosen theory to the method of inquiry.

EC is introduced as a new form of a pragmatist institutionalism, which assumes capable actors, a plurality of conventions and different forms of rationality. EC explains collective quality constructions and regards conventions as solutions for collectives to deal with uncertainty. EC criticizes mainstream economics because of its notion of rationality and its methodological individualism. The article focuses on the methodological standpoint of EC. It is argued that the influences from pragmatism and structuralism place this new institutionalism beyond pragmatism and structuralism and that its methodological position can be regarded as a ""complex pragmatic situationalism"". The situation is the unit of analysis. In situations pluralities of conventions have an impact as possible logics of coordination and evaluation. The EC has a strong tradition in empirical historical analysis of institutional forms and socio-cognitive categories. It is argued that parallels to the Weberian methodology exist. But EC supposes that ideal types are common knowledge also to the ordinary actors. At the end it is the specific complex methodological position of EC that places it also beyond the opposition of methodological individualism and methodological holism.","Actor-network-theory; Collective cognitive dispositives; Ãconomie des conventions; Economic sociology; Institutionalism; Laurent thevenot; Luc boltanski; Max weber; Pierre bourdieu; Pragmatism; Robert salais; Socio-cognition; Structuralism",,,,,,,"Agassi, J., Methodological individualism (1960) British Journal of Sociology, 11 (3), pp. 244-270; Bessis, F., Chaserant, C., Favereau, O., ThÌvenon, O., L'identitÃ© sociahe de l'homo conventionalis (2006) L'Ã©conomie des Conventions.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors use the introduction of electronic health records, part of the English National Programme of Information Technology, as an example to illustrate how theoretical lenses need to be effectively integrated with practical considerations in order to help researchers to overcome the theory-practice gap in relation to research in this area. Findings - Integrating actor-network theory (ANT) with other theoretical lenses can usefully inform the design of evaluation of the implementation of electronic health record systems into healthcare settings, but it is necessary that such deliberations are informed by guidance on how to use conceptual considerations in practice. Originality/value - The paper outlines how combining a case study-based approach informed by multi-sited ethnography and drawing on ANT offers a method for a theoretically-based approach to such evaluations.

This research uses Actor-Network Theory to retrace and reassemble the development of the tax from inception to implementation. From the fieldwork, six stages of the policy development process emerged, beginning with the surfacing of the concept of tax shifting in 1998 to the implementation of a carbon tax in 2008.

Design/methodology/approach: The author focuses, first, on the similarities between the worldviews of Chinese philosophy and post-Newtonianism; second, on how those changes in worldview support the emerging model of organization, whose management style one writer refers to as ""unmanaging""; and, third, on the benefits available for Chinese business people who apply their acculturated understanding of principles that still seem foreign to Western business people. Findings: This essay asserts that the worldview emerging from twentieth century science - primarily quantum mechanics and complexity theory - will reinforce many of the basic assumptions basic to Chinese culture and philosophy. As a result, Chinese managers and thinkers have the opportunity to make critical contributions to an emerging model of organization, which Western management thinkers have been predicting for nearly half a century. Practical implications: The paper offers a series of theoretical tools, taken from fields of study ranging from the philosophy of science to organizational dynamics, with which Chinese managers and thinkers can develop a leadership position in the discussion that has begun about what the author calls the post-Newtonian organizational model. Originality/value: The value of the essay lies in its integration of twentieth century science, Chinese philosophy and the study of organizations to indicate how Chinese managers and thinkers can help shape a new, trans-cultural way of understanding organizations, markets and finally, the world.

This paper argues that such a one-dimensional reading fails to attend closely to the academic identity work that is done when students talk together. Identity work has become a useful way of thinking about the nature of PhD study in the production of thesis texts, the development of PhD students as scholars and in the practices of everyday doctoral life. This paper extends this work by analysing various instances of PhD student 'troubles talk' in everyday interactions between peers and in online spaces where PhD students congregate. Attention to troubles talk allows us to explore how doctoral students might do academic identity work in the 'hinterlands' where academic subjectivity and other forms of subjectivity (wife, husband, parent, son, daughter etc.) start to blur into each other.

A quarter of a century later, this growing stream of research consists of some 65 published papers and has become one of the dominant alternative approaches used to explore accounting as an organizational and social practice. We review this literature based on the following two research questions; (i) what are the major achievements of this literature, and in what respects has it contributed to our understanding of accounting in relation to other alternative streams of accounting research, such as those grounded in critical theory, actor-network theory (ANT), new-institutional sociology (NIS) and practice theory? and; (ii) what are the limitations of the ST strand and, considering these (and its relative strengths), how should it be advanced in the future? Overall, we find that the mobilization of ST as a general ontological framework has generated three major and largely unique contributions, namely; (i) the introduction of a duality perspective; (ii) the conceptualization of accounting as an interwoven totality comprised of structures of signification, domination and legitimation, and; (iii) an ontological basis for theorizing how, when and why socially embedded agents may produce both continuity and change in accounting practices. However, we also conclude that it is difficult to identify a particular and distinctive empirical imprint of the ST literature, and that some of the theory's 'competitive advantages' are far from fully exploited. Based on these identified strengths and weaknesses of the ST perspective, we consider an array of directions for future scholarly effort.

These connections are commonly conceived in terms of the concept of transfer, integration or boundary crossing. Thinking these connections in this way, I claim, serves to consolidate a unitary, stable and fixed idea of the relationship between learning in educational institutions and work and inadvertently reduce its complexity. Drawing on empirical data collected over the course of qualitatively exploring the links between a problem-based program of teacher education ('learning') and the practice of participants in this program upon initial employment in schools ('work'), and deploying actor network theory, I trace new sorts of associations between work and learning and propose a relational conception of their connection. Challenging the common counter-positioning of work and learning, empirical analysis reveals their mutual constitution and partial connection in practices, here, of a predominantly pedagogic and spatial/material kind. Practices that occupy interstitial spaces have a particular resonance with regard to challenging this counter-positioning and unsettling the hierarchies of value which often arise from it.

Following a first generation of human-centered social networks, the notion of object-centered sociality has been introduced to describe the fact that strong social relationships are built mainly when individuals are grouped together around a shared object. In this paper we attempt to further enhance the notion of the social object and present the concept of heterogeneous social network, where humans and social objects are uniformly treated as equal actors. The paper discusses how this notion can be exploited in different application domains and presents in more detail a particular example from the field of medical education.

Karen FranÃ§ois's paper ""In-between science and politics"" follows Latour in arguing for the need for political theory to get out of the Platonic cave that it still inhabits. Political theory needs to be brought into the wild through empirical studies of how science and politics in fact intermix. And the Latourian proposition needs to be strengthened by focusing on the embodied knowledges that enable situated objectivities to emerge. Though worthwhile, these arguments are weakened by a superficial treatment of political theory and by a lack of attention to the difficulties involved in combining Latourian actor-network theory with the ""strong objectivity"" of standpoint theory. Most problematically the paper purports to define as an agenda (exploring the in-between of science and politics) what whole fields of inquiry have already been in full swing exploring for quite a while. The 'turn to ontology' in STS and social anthropology and the development of 'empirical philosophy' suggests what might be at stake in such explorations.

It outlines some of the characteristics of the ""cultural turn"" and some of the criticisms that have been levelled against it. In the body of the paper, I attempt to assess the value of the ""cultural turn"", conceptually and methodologically, as applied to two recent research projects on the geography of food and families. The paper concludes that the ""cultural turn"" greatly enriched the study of human geography through its analysis of discourse, representation and practice. But other approaches are required to explain broader changes in political-economy and the materiality of nature. While the ""cultural turn"" contributed to our understanding of materiality and our place in a more-than-human world, geographers are now also embracing other approaches such as those informed by actor-network theory and geographies of emotion, embodiment and affect. The paper concludes with an agenda for future research on the political and moral economies of food, focusing on contemporary consumer anxieties at a range of geographical scales.

But this emergence has proceeded very differently in institutional and in socio-cognitive aspects. From the beginnings of qualitative social research, critical stances toward science, the sociology of science, and methodological reflexivity organized self-observation. For a long time qualitative social research compared itself primarily to quantitative social research. But in the last years, qualitative social research began focusing more on its own processes and evaluative criteria. The concept of performativity is suitable to ground a theoretical reflection on this new focus in self-observation. This concept has proved useful in analyzing the practices of science, especially in approaches as Actor-Network-Theory and Social Studies of Finance. The article introduces the concept of performativity and describes those dimensions most relevant for the field of qualitative social research. An extended perspective for a sociology of social research is developed.

Due to cost constraints, only a few actors can be placed within a WSN application area. Determining which actor or set of actors should respond to an event is important, because the correct decision will increase the event response time and reduce energy expenditure. Since the mobile actors are widely dispersed over the application area, the actors' accurate location and energy details will not always be available. In this paper, we show that using info-gap decision theory to choose the correct actors to respond to an event when uncertainty about an actor's location and/or energy exists ensures that the actors chosen can adequately respond to the event. The robustness of the decision choice of the set of actor(s) assigned to respond to an event means that all chosen actor(s) have sufficient energy to respond to the event in real time.

This interpretive perspective is explored through a case study, investigating the pottery consumed in Anglo-Saxon Southampton, demonstrating how engagements through exchange, use and deposition were active in creating a patchwork of connections which came together to create a distinct social assemblage. In particular, the article considers the multitude of ways that pottery and people were categorized through material engagements and the interpretive and methodological challenges that this presents to archaeology as a whole.

The actor-network theory is used to show how beliefs, politics, laws, government agencies, and pressure groups in China interact to create outbound tourism as a new way of ordering. The analysis highlights how a hitherto nontraveling culture suddenly becomes a traveling culture and how outbound tourism has been accommodated, justified, institutionalized, and allowed to flourish in China. Tourism is analyzed as a social phenomenon concerning a complex interaction of heterogeneous objects in the formation of a dynamic network and ordering of human and non-human objects.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws from actor-network theory and Lefebvre's spatial-social approach to shed light on the organizational assumptions of the various building phases and how current employees use and make sense of the architectural space in the case organization. The methods used include participant observation, interviews of employees and architects, and interpretation of planning documents, architectural statements and administrative representations of the complex. Findings: It took over 30 years to build the campus. The original plans for the university buildings were substantially revised as architectural and organizational paradigms changed over time. However, regardless of the more recently built state-of-the-art facilities, the early architectural design ideas have persisted as material-social forces that participate in the ongoing production and reproduction of organizational space. Originality/value: Despite of the recent surge of writings on organizational space and architecture, there are relatively few empirical studies done on the topic. In particular, analyses investigating the travel of design ideas from architectural planning to actual physical constructions and further to the everyday organizing practices of employees have so far been rare in organizational literature. This paper partially fills this gap.

Western geographers began to study the connection between consumption practice and geography early in the 1990s, and today the research has already extended to the issues such as geographical imagination, place identity and space production, all of which could be reflected in consumption relationship. As a way of life under urbanization, consumption of body-building has become an important topic in the interdisciplinary field of body geography, space imagination and place construction. This paper analyzes how the actors translate body-building by some qualitative methods, on the basis of place theory of constructivism and actor network theory. The authors believe that the actors' consumption relationship socially constructed a ""healthy paradise"", which is geographically imagined, and the consumption imagination is highly connected with the stability of discourse power. Geographical space produces both functional consumption relationship and node-typical man-land relationship, and the latter imaginatively embeds local consumption relationship into global consumptive cultural network, which then links and extends local man-land relationship into globalization. By the way of body practice, the consumption relationship of body-building under actor network reconstructs micro-location into a place with multiple levels. Compared with traditional dualistic man-land relationship, the man-land relationship constructed by consumption of body-building is manifold. Here, place is a crucial node where reality is mixed with virtual world, and locality is intersected with global world. Therefore, place has the function of representation for social discourse. The conclusion indicates that a kind of manifold-and-node man-land relationship could be found in geographic micro-location. From the perspective of consumption geography, this paper explores the relationship between place construction and fitness club as a micro-location in a shopping mall, and also contributes to the research on shopping malls.","Construction; Consumption of body-building; Discourse; Micro-location; Place","globalization; human geography; interdisciplinary approach; metropolitan area; multistorey building",,,,,,"Mansvelt, J., Geographies of consumption (2008), pp. 26-104. , Lu Yixin trans., Taibei: National Institute for Compilation and Translation & Weber Publication International LtdJohnson, P., Maps of meaning: An introduction to cultural geography (1989), London: Unwin HymanRose, G., (1993) Feminism and Geography, , Oxford: Polity; Longhusrt, R., (Dis)embodied geographies (1997) Progress in Human Geography, 21 (4), pp. 486-501; Beson, S., The Body, health and eating disorders (1997) Identity and Difference, pp. 121-181. , Woodward K., London: Sage; Rose, G., Geography and gender, cartographies and corporealities (1995) Progress in Human Geography, 19 (4), pp. 544-548; Laws, G., Embodiment and emplacement: Identities, representation and landscape in Sun City Retirement Communities (1995) International Journal of Aging and Human Development, 40 (4), pp. 253-280; Mort, F., Cityscapes: Consumption, masculinities and mapping of London since 1950 (1998) Urban Studies, 35 (5-6), pp. 889-907; Gregson, N., Rose, G., Taking Bulter elsewhere: Performativities, spatialities, and subjectivities (2000) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 18 (4), pp. 433-452; Gregson, N., Crewe, L., Brooks, K., Discourse, displacement, and retail practice: Some pointers from the charity retail project (2002) Environment and Planning A, 34 (9), pp. 1661-1683; Harvey, D., The body as an accumulation strategy (1998) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 16 (4), pp. 401-421; Bell, D., Valentine, G., (1997) Consuming Geographies: We Are Where We Eat, , London: Routledge; Cook, I., Crang, P., Thorpe, M., Eating into Britishness: Multicultural imaginaries and identity politics of food (1999) Practising Identities: Power and Resistance, pp. 223-248. , Roseneil S and Seymour J., Basingstoke: Macmillan; Bruzzi, S., Gibson, P.C., (2000) Fashion Culture: Theories, Explorations and Analysis, , London: Routledge; (2008) Society of Consumption, pp. 120-155. , Baudrillard J, Liu Chengfu, Quan Zhigang trans., Nanjing: Nanjing University Press; Johnston, R.J., Gregory, D., Smith, D.M., (2004) The Dictionary of Human Geography, , Chai Yanwei et al. trans., Beijing: The Commercial Press; Gresswell, T., (2006) Place: A Short Introduction, , Wang Zhihong, Xu Tailing trans., Taibei: The Socio Publishing Co.

Research in the field is considered a form of critical perspective, and assumptions about technology are questioned. Technological determinism is introduced, and different positions on this concept are identified. These are used to discuss the ways in which work within the field might be described as technologically deterministic. Four theoretical perspectives (activity theory, communities of practice, actor-network theory, and the social construction of technology) are then briefly characterized, demonstrating that alternative positions are viable, and positioning each in relation to the earlier discussion of technological determinism. The paper concludes by arguing that research, building on such alternative conceptions of technology, is important in developing our understanding of the relationship between technology and learning, as well as identifying potential methodological implications.

The language project follows how the virtual universe known as Mingoville (http://www.mingoville.com) becomes an actor in English education for beginners. The virtual universe provides an online environment for students beginning to learn English in schools and at home. This article will focus on the shifting ontologies of Mingoville and teaching and learning situations in beginners' English. It takes as its point of departure neither Mingoville as part of the media ecologies of the classroom, nor the epistemological ramifications of Mingoville. Instead, it suggests that opening up the shifting ontologies of Mingoville (i.e. what mediates Mingoville and its relationships with doing beginners' English) may offer a different and useful approach to understanding how Mingoville becomes a multiple actor. It reveals that such an actor both influences and is influenced by manifold constitutive entanglements involved in organizing English teaching and learning activities for beginners. Theoretically and methodologically, the article and the empirical gatherings and analysis are inspired by science and technology studies (STS) and Actor Network Theory (ANT). The arguments and descriptions provided throughout the article will focus on the shifting ontologies of Mingoville as it moves into, and out of, different teaching and learning situations of English for beginners.",,,,,,,,"Bang, J., Findes der en dansk tradition for netbaseret undervisning?

The results of the study show that the basic functionalities are of strategic importance for the enrolment of local actors in the portal development and its use. These functionalities act as enrolment devices. In complex environments, critical success factors for network formation require local support based on present usefulness of the functionalities and on long-term project organization that safeguards their future development.

It illuminates the reflexive processes of inscription, translation and re-inscription as technologies evolve by examining the development and classroom use of Texas Instruments'TI-Nspireâ¢. To investigate the development and use of TI-Nspire, research from the field of Science and Technology Studies is drawn on that provides insights into the relationship between development, technology, and users while avoiding essentialist positions that obscure either technological or human aspects of the relationship. The findings show that rather than being a linear process where the technology is passed from developer to teacher to student, the development and use of TI-Nspire involves multiple feedback loops with constant reconfiguration. These loops occur at several levels as teachers and students integrate the technology into their mathematical activity and these reconfigurations feed into new versions of the technology.

The analysis unravels that the existing theories, not withstanding their strengths, have failed in one way or the other to provide an integrated frame-work that is comprehensive in explaining and predicting IT adoption behavior by SMEs. How-ever, the paper sought to bridge the gap in knowledge by drawing from the reviewed models, in-cluding Social Network Theory (SNT) and Actor-network Theory (ANT), to propose Socio-Psycho Networks Complexity Theory (SPNCT). SPNCT integrates social, economic, psychologi-cal and other environmental variables of IT decision-making team with a view to providing more comprehensive scholarly lenses for explaining and predicting the idiosyncrasies of each actor.

ANT recognises that all objects and things exhibit consciousness, and through a consciousness, interact heterogeneously in space; the location of the interaction(s), where they are performed homogeneously, is the landscape. If, as ANT promotes, all objects and things exhibit consciousness, then the closer in space they are to one another, the more essential they are to each other. These notions have specific ties to the on-going critique in landscape studies of focusing on rural and local scales, and the continuing debate in human (and physical) geography regarding the necessity of scale itself. Using ANT as a framework, and punctuated with true-life anecdotes, this article wraps the landscape-created-by-nature and the landscape-created-by-human debates into a non-dialectic whole, demonstrating, perhaps provocatively and controversially, that any landscape should be distinctly anti-dialectic and removed from scalar constraints. While ANT remains an often-overlooked and misunderstood technique for studying the landscape, this article's crux rests in nothing less than attempting to lay the groundwork for using ANT as a practical technique when studying any landscape in any location at any time (and in any related disciplinary field). If indeed, as argued in this paper and as ANT suggests, everything is networked, then scale, specifically when applied to any landscape, becomes irrelevant. Â© 2011 The Author.

Yet, there is still a heated debate on the nature of opportunities. The discovery view argues that opportunities are discovered and have objective existence prior to the entrepreneurial process. The creation view argues that the discovery view is incomplete and makes wrongful assumptions about agency, process and opportunities in entrepreneurship. More conceptual development, however, is needed for the creation view to become a fully developed theoretical alternative to the discovery view. In this article, Actor-Network Theory is used to develop the creation view and further our understanding of entrepreneurial processes.

The proposed method solves the shortcoming of the keyword-based approach to identification of technology trends, i.e., that it cannot represent how technologies are used or for what purpose. The concept of function provides information on how a technology is used and how it interacts with other technologies; the keyword-based approach does not provide such information. The proposed method uses an SAO model and represents ""key concept"" instead of ""key word"". We present a procedure that formulates an SAO network by using SAO models extracted from patent documents, and a method that applies actor network theory to analyze technology implications of the SAO network. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the SAO network this paper presents a case study of patents related to Polymer Electrolyte Membrane technology in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells.

Framed by actor-network theory, it draws upon data consistently collected between June 2005 and October 2008, and then intermittently through October 2010, to consider the ways in which policy technologies, such as standardized testing, bring together New York City (NYC) public schools, district administrators, for-profit educational support businesses, and government officials to address the accountability requirements of NCLB. This article reveals how, through a range of sophisticated mechanisms that support the generation and comparison of data, NYC schools become reduced to data calculation and management centers. NCLB's standardization, privatization, and marketization encourage local policy actors to become complicit in standardizing and quantifying academic assessment through their reliance on services and products marketed to schools and districts that are not meeting academic benchmarks. These services, mostly offered by for-profit vendors, help keep schools in compliance with policy requirements, but replace a focus on student learning with the production, management, and sometimes the fabrication, of data.

We engage with ongoing debates in geography and the broader social sciences on the need to move beyond linearity in the analysis of commodity/value chains and global production networks. Our analysis suggests that the problem of linearity may be an artefact of theoretical and methodological presuppositions, which explains its longevity as an issue in methodological approaches and empirical research. Recent theoretical insights from actor network theory, combined with our own research on electronic waste, provide a potential solution to the problem of linearity. Our research points to the need for a focus on 'actions', not just 'things', in tracing economic activity.

His contribution to modern sociology has been even more provocative and controversial because it was established during the major debates about modernity and postmodernity, and it was often met with criticism, which sometimes even disputed his relevance for the discipline of sociology. The paper covers and interprets three main issues which dominate Latour's opus: the problem of modernity, because Latour claims that ""we were never modern""; the problem of political ecology, because Latour insists on its great importance and attempts to formulate a completely new and diff erent concept of political ecology; the problem of sociology, because Latour relies on the belief that there is a demand for change, not only from the contemporary society but also from sociology as the science of society. He, therefore, problematizies the traditional concept of society as well as the science of sociology itself. He shows that sociology should be reestablished and thinks that the establishment of sociology should go in the direction of actor-network theory or the sociology of associations.","Actor-network; Association; Collectivity; Hybrid(s); Insecurity; Modernity; Nature; Political ecology","actor network theory; anthropology; modernity; political geography; social history",,,,,,"Barnes, B., The Macro/Micro Problem and the Problem of Structure and Agency (2003) Handbook of Social Theory, , U: Ritzer, G./Smart, B. /ur./, London/Thousand Oaks/ New Delhi: Sage Publications; BÃ©raud, C., Coulmont, C., (2008) Les courants contemporains de la sociologie, , Paris: PUF; Berthelot, J.-M., (1990) L'Intelligence du social, , Paris: Presses Universitaires de France; Callon, M., Latour, B., Le grand leviathan s'apprivoise-t-il?

This city was chosen for this purpose due to the notoriety achieved by the Digital PiraÃ­ program, the origins of which date back to 1996. An approach based on the actor-network theory (ANT) was applied to evaluate the program. ANT was used to develop a model of digital inclusion, as well as investigate the formation of heterogeneous networks of actors around the components of the aforementioned model in PiraÃ­. After collecting data in PiraÃ­ related to its digital program, interviewing several inhabitants, public administrators and merchants based in the municipality, with respect to their perceptions regarding this endeavor and analyzing this material vis - vis the digital inclusion model developed via the actor-network theory, it can be concluded that digital inclusion is a reality in PiraÃ­, despite the fact that its effects do not benefit all segments of the society equally. The municipality presents different levels of appropriation of the advantages of information technology (IT), from the municipal executive body, students and teachers of the public school system - who have already progressed with the incorporation of IT in their daily lives - to the general public, including tradespeople and entrepreneurs, who are still far from reaping the full benefits of the digital inclusion movement. Lastly, some managerial and academic implications accrued from this research as well as the limitations of the study are set forth. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular focus is the reformatting of organic milk around the turn of the millennium and the following attempts by various actors to make this product more accessible for a larger group of consumers. The approach favored in this undertaking is actor-network theory (ANT), which stresses the distributed nature of moral agency and that human and non-human elements of actor networks should be given equal attention when accounting for societal practices. Economic narratives such as the sovereign consumer are also used to shed light on the constitution of organic milk as a moral object and the positioning of this product relative to products stemming from conventional agriculture.

I will do this by addressing some crucial differences between this approach and the project of critical urban studies, which, as Brenner et al. noted, is not thoroughly discussed in the aforementioned volume. I think there are four fundamental matters to be discussed: the style of cognitive engagement (inquiries or critique), the definitions of the object of study (cities or capitalism), the underlying conceptions of the social (assemblages or structures) and the envisaged political projects (democratization or revolution). Obviously these pairs of concepts don't represent clear-cut distinctions. They do, however, signalize differences of emphasis making up the politics of urban assemblages.

We offer evidence that designing and implementing its domain approach enhanced the productivity and symbiosis of Shell's innovation efforts, and use 'Actor Network Theory' - a conceptual framework extensively used in science and technology studies - to explain how this success was achieved. Domains not only link strategy and technology; but also marry up 'bottom-up' and 'top-down' innovations and connect the shorter with the longer term. The article's consideration of domains renders the notion of ANT analyses more accessible and relevant for long term strategy professionals, as well as making some of the specific lessons Shell derived from its experience more widely available for application elsewhere.

Drawing on data from more than five years of ethnographic fieldwork amongst 'AAA' videogame development studios, the specific case of Spider-Man 3's development is used as a lens for understanding the complexity of modern media production practice. This case sheds light on our understandings of cross-media development practice and the labor involved in the effect of media 'flow' from platform to platform. Actor-Network Theory serves as a guiding analytic framework for understanding how videogame production in this context, given the sheer number of actors, has significant implications for the kinds of cross-media products created and the labor involved in bringing these projects to fruition.

We focus on the implementation, from the early 2000s onwards, of a reform of public management in France which called for a revision of the description of the boundaries and achievements of the action of the state. The reform targeted the rules governing the budgetary process and included, along with new accounting methods, new forms of reporting and assessment aimed at identifying the performance of governmental and administrative action. We consider the implementation process as a set of trials of explicitness in which a number of state practitioners struggled to elucidate the meaning of the reform and were confronted with pragmatic interrogations on what the state is and does. We analyze, using archival material, a number of such trials in the domain of national science and research policy, focusing on the development of managerial vocabularies and performance metrics.

The purpose of this paper is therefore to investigate the relationship between organizational identities and innovation with regards to strategy. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on the current research stream on innovation and strategy process. The study is based on a longitudinal case study of strategy and innovation processes in a small Norwegian food producer. Through analyzing two different innovation and product development processes in a Norwegian food producer, one related to creative recombination and the other to reproduction of established practice, the paper illustrates how organizational identities influence sensemaking during strategy processes, and thus the inclusion of innovation in the strategy. Findings: Identity can be used as an explanation for why some actions are deemed to be strategic while others are not, hence enforcing or limiting innovation. The paper finds that identity needs to be considered both as a ""soft"" and a ""hard"" concept in the process; providing stability while at the same time being up for re-negotiation. By understanding strategizing and innovating as situated and heterogeneous processes, it identifies how identity becomes a stabilizer and an organizer during emergent strategy processes, and reveals tensions between creative recombination and conservative reproduction. Orginality/value: This paper provides a richer understanding of innovation and strategy formation by suggesting that construction of organizational identity is central to the strategy process.

Whereas previous studies of cultural production have identified social factors in cultural production, this article sets out to investigate how the evolving object may form an active part in the collaborative process of its making. The article identifies three moments when the evolving object becomes decisive for the collaboration: the idea has to be detached to enable collaboration; attachments between collaborators are made via the evolving object; and closure of the product is postponed to enhance creative development. Thus, the article suggests that cultural objects and the processes of their making are co-produced, evolve simultaneously and are mutually constitutive.

In line with constructivist studies of medicine and technology, this paper conceptualizes routine medical work as being fundamentally marked by uncertainty and indeterminate situations. To account for the agency of the means of medical practice in such situations, current discussions about the agency of technology are critically reflected and adapted to the analysis of medical technologies. Drawing on ethnographic observations in operating theaters this paper traces the empirical distribution of medical work between ensembles of humans and machines as well as the handling of uncertainties in daily practice.

Exploring the case of contested carbon market designs in global climate governance, however, this article argues that performativity analysts have so far failed to pay sufficient attention to the political dimensions of marketization. Adopting insights from recent materialist approaches to the politics of technoscience, the article addresses this imbalance by outlining three modalities of technoeconomic citizenship, as these interfere with the shaping of specific carbon market designs. Drawing on web-based research tools and document analysis, each modality is illustrated via transnational environmental NGO practices of contestation, particularly in the global South. The performativity programme, it is concluded, stands to gain from conceptualizing politics as dynamic assemblages of collectiveactors, sites of contestation and technologies of witnessing. Re-framing performativity in this direction allows for a reintegration of economics into a wider political ecology of contested eco-sciences.

We depart from the notion that innovation processes are highly contingent, messy and non-linear and examine ways in which these processes have been studied. Our focus is on the challenges posed by the use of ethnographic methods to study innovation in-the-making. Our discussion is illustrated by an example culled from a longitudinal, real-time study of an innovation process in the food industry, inspired by actor-network theory (ANT) and its injunctions to focus on controversies and follow the actors. We conclude that although innovation ethnographies pose plenty of theoretical, methodological and practical challenges, they remain a promising and powerful method to map out the complex and tortuous paths of these processes.

This study constructs an approach to spate irrigation as a landscape technology by selectively fusing concepts of resilience ecology, political ecology, and actor-network theory. It is applied to a case study of the Calicanto area (Cochabamba, Bolivia) with emphasis on the 1990-1993 period. Calicanto spate irrigation provided an effective landscape technology over more than 15km 2 and 3500 fields via a 65-km canal network, thus comprising the largest spate-irrigated area of Latin America. Use of this irrigation technology was linked to climate variability and environmental variation as well as landscape features, livelihood diversification including widespread migration, and innovative high-agrobiodiversity land use, in addition to community resource management, settlement patterning, population density, and production intensity. Notwithstanding social-ecological resilience and versatility, the trajectory of this irrigation underwent major change with new waterworks launched in 1993. Key lessons for the related social-ecological sciences, development policy, and sustainability perspectives include: (i) versatility and viability of spate irrigation hinges on multiple social-ecological links; and (ii) its limitations include eclipse via irrigation trajectories lacking social-ecological analytic and conceptual capacities, and widespread albeit largely unacknowledged biases against the landscape technology of spate irrigation.

In both cases, electronic systems have played a key role in French primary fish markets. The computerisation of trading rooms started in the mid 1980s while connection through Intranet or Internet systems first started in the mid-1990s and then has spread more actively in France since 2007. However, the socioeconomic impact (on prices for example) of expanding markets by electronic means is far from being clearly predictable. First based on an econometric analysis, this article presents evidence of increases in price level and variability after the implementation of local electronic auction systems. Secondly, a comprehensive survey of the 40 fish auction markets in France brings additional information about the effects of electronic remote bidding on fish prices. The analysis of these two empirical outcomes uses the cross-fertilization of the positivist auction theory in economics with the constructionist approach of Actor-Network Theory (ANT) in sociology to enrich the potential hypotheses lying behind the study of the structural impact of electronic systems on market prices.

By the end of September 2008, there were just over 800 reports linking the new formulation to a range of adverse reactions: joint and muscle pain, weight gain and depression, conjunctivitis, skin rash, and visual disturbances. In response to the prevalence of reports of adverse reactions, an alternative medication, Goldshield, was approved and offered to the public at a subsidised rate. This was despite assurances that the new Eltroxin formulation was safe for use: Medsafe, the government agency responsible for regulating therapeutic products in New Zealand, and an independent medicines monitoring group, stated there was no medical or physiological basis for the supposed adverse reactions. Using media coverage, agency press releases, and meeting minutes of the agencies involved, the paper employs an Actor-Network Theory-based (ANT) approach to understand how the controversy arose, how it took the form it did, and how it was ultimately settled. We explored how, during the controversy, actors emerged, delineated themselves, and concurrently prompted other actors to do the same, as they defined and debated the nature of the risk of Eltroxin. By using an ANT approach, it is possible to illustrate how various actors, including the lay-public, collectively shape the activities of apparatuses that regulate and provide medicines. Thus, we believe such an analysis demonstrates the importance of using public controversies about health risk as an analytical focal point for understanding how various forces shape contemporary society.

The engineering profession is central to achieving sustainable development. To date, engineering contributions to sustainability have focused on reducing the environmental impacts of development and improving the efficiency of resource use. This approach is consistent with dominant policy responses to environmental problems, which have been characterised as ecological modernisation. Ecological modernisation assumes that sustainability can be addressed by reforming modern society and developing environmental technologies. Environmental philosophers have questioned these assumptions and call into question the very nature of modern society as underlying the destruction of nature and the persistence of social inequality. Central to the crises of ecology and human development are patterns of domination and the separation of nature and culture. Engineering has a clear role to play in ecological modernisation, but its role in more radical visions of sustainability is uncertain. Actor-network theory provides an analysis of socio-technical systems which does not require the separation of nature and culture, and it provides a way of thinking about how engineers are involved in shaping society and its relationship to the environment. It describes the world in terms of relationships between human and non-human actors. It shows that social relationships are mediated by technologies and non-human nature, and that assumptions about society and behaviour are ""baked-in"" to technological systems. Modern infrastructure systems are particularly important in shaping society and have significant environmental impacts. Modern infrastructure has allowed the consumption of resources far beyond basic human needs in developed countries. Failure to deliver infrastructure services has resulted in billions of the world's poorest people missing out on the benefits of modern development. Engineers have an important role to play in developing new infrastructure systems which acknowledge the relationships between technology and society in shaping demand for resources and environmental impacts, as well as alleviating poverty. Engineers have an important role in mediating between the values of society, clients, the environment and the possibilities of technology. Constructive Technology Assessment and Value Sensitive Design are two methodologies which engineers are using to better account for the social and ethical implications of their work. Understanding engineering as a hybrid, socio-technical profession can help develop new ways of working that acknowledge the importance of technology and infrastructure in shaping social relationships that are central to achieving sustainability.

This paper is intended to persuade designers to consider using Actor-Network Theory (ANT) in order to gain insights about the existence and the nature of complex relationships occurring within a usage scenario. ANT allows for the creation of network maps that may offer insights about future interactions that are useful for gauging the appropriateness of a particular technological intervention. Guidelines are offered for using ANT for design. Future work is being done to further establish and validate methodologies for creating ANT network maps.

Often, new CMS implementations fail. A possible aspect of failures is the perception by employees of being ""watched"" by CMS. Since all information systems can inherently collect data, they can all monitor employees at some level, even if it's not their primary purpose. Therefore, users might sense they are being watched, triggering panoptic perceptions. This research in progress endeavors to understand the panoptic phenomenon and resulting CMS implementation failure via Actor Network Theory (ANT). Specifically, a published case study on a CMS failure within a medical organization is revisited to investigate organizational dynamics of misaligned interests between the cast of characters. Through ANT, the reader attains a better understanding of the technological and social factors that affected the CMS implementation and the underlying processes that led to its failure. Implications and future research are discussed.

Drawing from fieldwork at a Polish tourist destination, the article demonstrates how a rather unlikely destination actor, the oscypek cheese, is enacted in different versions as it engages with tourism, tradition, craftsmanship, hygiene and legislation. It is described how four versions of the cheese impact the destination by producing, shaping and altering destination realities and how reality-shaping requirements, possibilities and controversies are constantly negotiated and altered through the linkage of multiple actors, discourses and practices. It is argued that actor-network theory may help to elucidate this working of non-human actors and the subsequent enactment of multiple tourism realities.

Privatization has not gone well for most low-income consumers in Nicaragua, who have faced rising and unaffordable tariffs and frequent power cuts that have been economically and psychologically devastating. Scholarship on privatization has focused on the social injustices and exclusions that privatization often engenders, but very little attention has been paid to how privatization is enacted materially. To implement privatization successfully across space, privatizers have to delegate some of their action to nonhumans that they anticipate will function as black-boxed intermediaries. In landscapes of economic hardship and popular suspicion, however, these intermediaries sometimes turn into mediators or technologies with political effects. Electricity consumers have resorted to a range of tactics to subvert the strategies of Spanish multinational UnÃ­on Fenosa, which took over the distribution of electricity, and these tactics have involved the creative and opportunistic enrollment of nonhumans. By tracing the shifting associations between the heterogeneous actors that make up the electricity (actor-) network, I seek to illuminate the relational materialisms in the consumption of privatized electricity and their potential for political transformation. An actor-network theory approach enables us to observe, amidst the entanglement of neoliberalizing maneuvers and disabling effects, material practices and translations in the network that are not always disempowering for ordinary people. It also reveals the contingency of multinational power and the (un)making of the global political economy in the spaces of everyday life.

Actors-traditionally individuals, institutions, and collectives-have been central to delivering such goals in practice. However, the definition of actors within the discipline has been narrow and their role in influencing conservation outcomes inadequately conceptualised. In this paper, we examine the question â²What is a conservation actorâ² Who or what creates the capacity to influence conservation values and actions Drawing from theoretical developments in Actor-Network Theory and collective governance, we argue that the concept of an actor in conservation biology should be broadened to include non-humans, such as species and devices, because they have the agency and ability to influence project goals and outcomes. We illustrate this through four examples: the Asian elephant, International Union for Conservation of Nature red lists, the High Conservation Value approach, and an Integrated Conservation and Development Project. We argue that a broader conceptualisation of actors in conservation biology will produce new forms of understanding that could open up new areas of conservation research, enhance practice and draw attention to spheres of conservation activity that might require stronger oversight and governance.

A shared view among these organisations is that IT strategy allows all parts of the organisation to gain a shared understanding of priorities, goals and objectives for both current and future states as defined in the strategy. It would therefore seem that IT strategy, for the foreseeable future will remain a key aspect of development within organisations. As a result, there has been more focus on how IT strategy is articulated and formulated. What is missing is that there has been less attention on the implementation of the strategy. Also, in most organisations, technical issues are minor compared to the relationship issues. There are many factors which influence the implementation of the IT strategy. This paper focuses on how organisational politics as examined by two underpinning theories, Structuration Theory and Actor-Network Theory, impact the implementation of IT strategy.

However, such conservation strategies are often in conflict with the traditions, practices and land-use priorities of local communities. This article concentrates on the situation concerning the predation of reindeer (mainly by wolves) in Finland's southeast reindeer herding area and its immediate vicinity, but makes reference to the broader situation of predation and reindeer herding in Finland. Based on analysis of statistics and interviews with local stakeholders, the research findings refer to the intermingled contradictions related to conceptual, statistical and other management relevant knowledge and resulting problems, for example, in conservation hunting licensing. The article concludes that the wolf comprises a complex case for nature conservation initiatives and sustainable reindeer husbandry and that, in practice, it has particular implications compared to other policy approaches to dealing with the problem of animal predators. The article ends with some theoretical considerations as to whether we can improve our understanding of modern human-environment relations by deriving ideas from the actor-network theory debates.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper follows the qualitative case study strategy. Data were collected by interviewing (tape-recording) managers and staff, analysing relevant written project material, and conducting non-participant observations. Findings: The findings suggest that the implementation of CI depends on the emergence of a ""favouring"" network from the dynamic associations between heterogeneous entities. This network aims at facilitating change leadership, establishing behaviour/culture prone to CI, and constructing a behaviour non-resistant to CI needed for creating competencies for the continuous roll-outs of such changes. Continuous translation is the underlying mechanism for establishing the favouring network. Originality/value: The paper addresses the literature gap regarding the role of dynamic actor associations in shaping CI in a public sector context. It does not aim at generalising the results of the case study; it informs current theory by revealing that the success of CI deployment depends on the emergence of a CI-favouring network, which will continuously transform opposing views into accepting CI.

The lack of valid tools to evaluate the quality of partnerships is a significant constraint to formulating convincing arguments for this kind of action. In light of this shortcoming, the tool described in this article evaluates processes of collective action based on key aspects of its effectiveness. Method: The tool is based on a theoretical model that followed from case studies identifying the conditions associated with quality of partnerships. The tool was developed by operationalizing these conditions into a series of statements, and pretested using the cognitive interviewing method. Construct validity and ecological validity were verified. Results: The tool includes 18 items, with 3 answer choices provided for each item. It is sensitive to variations in judgement. It allows for good convergence among respondents from participating organizations within a partnership; it can also distinguish between partnerships that have difficulty meeting certain conditions and those that do not. The tool is suitable for self-evaluation of partnerships engaged in common projects that involve more than information exchange. Discussion: The tool's validity resides in its validation procedure and in the basic soundness of its theoretical model, which is supported by a number of literature reviews on how partnerships function and their results.

It is based on a field study of the events following the announcement of collective redundancies at a Swedish high-tech company. Although more than 10,000 workers were dismissed, the company was accepted as being socially responsible. The study reveals that this outcome was the result of a process whereby corporate representatives managed to enrol and mobilize a network of actors into being faithful to, and defending, their definition of social responsibility. This indicates that a company can assume an active role in the construction of the same network of actors that it is asked to respond to and impose upon other actors its own definition of what it means to be socially responsible. As a result, the translation of CSR within the network of actors may reinforce the powerful position of the company, rather than curb it.

This interview literature is part of a tradition of taking up the problem of power inequalities in relation to the people we study. This article argues that not all types of social scientific research interviews benefit from an Ã  priori problematization of power and control, ethics and equality, or emancipation. From a constructivist perspective, the article seeks to displace the methodological concern with power related to the ideas of studying up or down and introduce another set of concerns in relation to producing good empirical material when we ""study sideways."" The argument is based on analyses of interview situations from a concrete research project, where researcher and researched share professional background to some degree, where negotiations replace a researcher-imposed dialogue, and where the circulation of shared or common concepts messes up an orderly division between researchers' vocabulary and interviewees' vocabularies. It is proposed that when we study sideways, we must cultivate interview methods which cause confrontation and disagreement-not to acknowledge asymmetry but to enhance the quality of research.

The paper uses an empirical example of the television 'live' broadcast within the genre of 24-hour rolling news which relies so heavily upon the 'live' event, to argue that such an occasion enables actors to construct various simultaneous and sometimes conflicting chronograms which are performed or enacted within network space alongside 'Newtonian time frames'. The theoretical intervention being explored here is that such an event as the extended 'live' news coverage of a particular story - here the release of the BBC journalist Alan Johnston from having been held hostage in the Middle East - is best explored through the lens of the chronogram, to reveal how the mechanics of the production of the television 'live' constructs or enacts various fluid temporal zones that exist alongside one another within networked space and that many of these zones remain deliberately and crucially concealed from the television audience.

These discussions have in many ways (and for good reasons) distanced performative from ostensive research. Recently, however, several scholars have emphasized the interdependencies between ostensive and performative aspects when it comes to knowledge development, thereby underlining the need to coordinate ostensive and performative studies and bring them closer together. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the methodological opportunities and limitations for ANT researchers who seek to move closer to ostensive research. Design/methodology/ approach: The basis for exploring the opportunities and threats stemming from integration at the methodological level is a comparison of performative and ostensive case study methodologies as they have been presented in research. Robert K. Yin's case study methodology is chosen to represent an ostensive view whereas performative case study methodology is represented by the methodological reflections of Bruno Latour, John Law, and Michel Callon. Findings: The paper illustrates how the process is a balancing act. On the one hand, it requires performative researchers to relate more closely to aspects decisive for ostensive researchers; yet, on the other, they need to preserve the distinctiveness of the performative approach. Originality/value: This paper exemplifies these issues with reference to management accounting research and contributes by clarifying the methodological implications of moving performative research closer to ostensive research.

Though the value of such integration is uncontested, it does raise several questions relating to stakeholder collaboration. Despite substantial research in this field, there remain gaps in our knowledge of the micro-dynamics of stakeholder collaborations in building tourism/cultural systems. This paper contributes to this debate by investigating the micro-level interactions among stakeholders during the conceptualisation of a large collaborative project: a Cultural District. Drawing on Actor-Network Theory (ANT) the research shows that, though rigid sequential planning is not viable, conceptualisation is facilitated by deploying three ANT rules: enrolling actors, fact-building and circulating translations. These rules are used to define a "" conditional path"" whereby specific actions are activated when controversies emerge.

Although this shift has gained significant momentum its general theoretical significance remains somewhat unclear and the concept is vulnerable to criticisms that it is incoherent, too 'micro-scale' in emphasis, unable to provide valid links between everyday practices and higher-order phenomena (eg, institutions, class structures), and that, in some cases, it lacks a sound political economy. This paper argues that while it undoubtedly has limitations, the practice-oriented shift represents an ongoing development of a longstanding and heterodox field of social scientific interest from both within and beyond the subdiscipline. We first highlight the diverse strands of economic geography scholarship that have an explicit interest in practices and then propose an epistemological and methodological framework for a practice-oriented economic geography. The framework is based on the polemical argument that insight from both critical realist and actor-network perspectives can provide the basis to better demarcate practices in relation to their social and spatiotemporal dimensions. It goes on to outline a reformulated retroductive methodology to assess the impacts and theoretical significance of particular economic-geographical practices. The paper concludes that practice offers a potentially powerful, yet complementary, epistemological tool that can create conceptual space for the study of a wide range of socioeconomic and geographical phenomena.

To solve this problem, I draw on Bruno Latour's actor-network theory (ANT) to theorize the development of three key elements of cosmopolitanism: cultural omnivorousness, ethnic tolerance, and cosmopolitics. ANT illuminates how humans and nonhumans of multiple nationalities develop attachments with one another to create network structures that sustain cosmopolitanism. ANT also helps the sociology of cosmopolitanism become more reflexive and critical of its implicit normative claims.

The sociology of associations is used to explore the micro-foundations of logics, their emergence and temporal-spatial importance. A case study of the construction of the skyscraper, 'Turning Torso', in MalmÃ¶ city, shows how technical objects and actions implicated in the material practices of building construction shape logics and identities associated with professions, economy, market, science and design. We summarize our findings by theorizing logics and identities as emergent and contingent outcomes of the material practices of building construction. The argument is concluded by considering the building construction as a materially mediated meaning structure.

The use of statistics and numbers seems to be a prerequisite for conducting a policy that is both efficient and effective. The kind of knowledge thus produced is regarded as factual and scientific. This article tries to get a grasp on value-added modelling, a commonly used method supposed to produce such knowledge. Drawing on some conceptual underpinnings of actor-network theory, the article advances that such factual matters often take the form of matters of educational performance that are shaped and produced by means of calculative and inscription devices. However, the adagio that measures of performances should guide education policy is only one, albeit strong, point of view. Taking not only performances but also public issues into account could lead to what could be called a more 'concernoriented' policy.

By suggesting actor-network theory as a methodological approach to the study of the mediatisation of religion, this article proposes a case study of the viral wedding video, J K wedding entrance dance, to highlight problems with the assertion that the media are replacing or displacing religion's authoritative role in society. Drawing upon recent theories of how digital and mobile media are reshaping society by enabling participation, remediation and bricolage, I suggest instead that the media do not bring about secularisation, but rather that the media are contributing to a personalisation of what it means to be religious (or not). This article thus introduces an alternative definition to the concept of mediatisation: that mediatisation may be understood as the process by which collective uses of communication media extend the development of independent media industries and their circulation of narratives, contribute to new forms of action and interaction in the social world and give shape to how we think of humanity and our place in the world.

The paper is in three parts: first, it briefly looks backwards, charting this emergence to the uptake of the work of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari as a counterpoint and extension of the earlier engagement with the concept of the network, primarily in actor-network theory (ANT); second, it makes this argument for being vigilant with assemblages through focusing attention on the tetravalent characteristics of the concept of the Deleuze-Guattarian assemblage, emphasising the way this points to alternative arrays of matter and thought. This segues into the third section, which situates the debates in our contemporary understandings of our technological and biochemical condition. The point being that we need precisely the kind of assemblage thinking proposed by Deleuze and Guattari to seize the agenda on the emergent micro- and eco-logical implications these arrays of matter and thought produce; the agenda proposed is exampled through understanding the assemblage concept through the work of Catherine Malabou on that of plasticity and habit, clear extensions in the 21st century of Deleuze and Guattari's earlier ideas.

Using empirical data collected via participant observation and interviews with rock climbers based in northern England, the paper highlights three case studies that help us rethink our situated activities as implicitly mediated and coconstituted by technology. First, it explores how new spaces of climbing co-produce climbing bodies resulting in differing and sometimes geographically specific skills and attributes. Second, the paper examines the climber's foot-shoe-rock assemblage in order to rethink the plasticity of body and technology as enhanced capabilities emerge throug the co-evolution of the assemblage. Third, it investigates how bouldering mats extend safe levels of climbing performance whilst altering climbers' relations with the crag. The paper concludes by illustrating that the study of climbing provides insight and critique about the role of human/non-human agency and the situated dynamics of human-technological hybrids.

It focuses on the challenges of translation within the field of tobacco control, but we argue that the insights are widely generalisable. Actor-Network Theory is used to frame an analysis, supplemented by focussed discussions with international tobacco control practitioners (service delivery and advocacy) and researchers. The central challenge to translation is that researchers and practitioners have different ""practical ontologies"". Researchers use findings from specific contexts to generalise to universal principles, while practitioners try to use these generalisations to inform their work in what are typically a somewhat different set of specific contexts. Neglecting the need to translate back from the general to the particular means research syntheses are not framed to meet practitioners' needs. Traditional knowledge broking roles need to be extended to better align the needs of researchers and practitioners. This may be facilitated by more creative use of ""social computing"" to enable real-time input into research syntheses from all interested parties, including input to the questions that research addresses. To do this systematically requires that we construct ""generalisation gradients"" to help practitioners apply general research conclusions to their particular situation and researchers to identify the relevance of their work. Disadvantaged communities in particular need help, since there is typically less research directly applicable to their contexts; thus, they need to generalise more.

I would like to suggest that the two be thought of dialectically, both as concepts and as actually-existing things in the world. After outlining my use to date of these concepts, and their deployment in my research into colonial India, I will counterpoise Giorgio Agamben's and Giles Deleuze's reflections on Michel Foucault's use of the term dispositif/apparatus. Deleuze's obvious and acknowledged indebtedness to Foucault's work, but his explicit re-rendering of the Foucauldian interest in order with the Deleuzian conceptualisation of dis-order, will be used to conclude with some methodological suggestions regarding how Deleuze and Foucault, agencement and dispositif, assemblages and apparatuses, can and should be thought together.

Two qualities come to mind. First off, it allows for non-coherence as a way of thinking about how institutional arrangements of power more or less hold together, despite being made up of a co-existence of often diverse logics and practices. Second, spatio-temporal assemblages offer a way of understanding the various power plays that shape, say, the politics of regions and nation states, by invoking a topological sensibility around proximity and distance that appears more productive than the familiar topographies of scale and networks. Weighed against such attractions, however, the notion of assemblage lends itself to a number of pitfalls: endless description is one, weak conceptualisation another. Â© 2011 The Author.

We propose a qualitative observational study of how safety is produced or not produced in the complex context of everyday professional mental health practice. Such an approach intentionally contrasts with much patient safety research which assumes that safety is achieved and improved through top-down policy directives. We seek instead to understand and articulate the connections and dynamic interactions between people, materials, and organisational, legal, moral, professional and historical safety imperatives as they come together at particular times and places to perform safe or unsafe practice. As such we advocate an understanding of patient safety 'from the ground up'. Methods/Design. The proposed project employs a six-phase data collection framework in two mental health settings: an inpatient unit and a community team. The first four phases comprise multiple modes of focussed, unobtrusive observation of professionals at work, to enable us to trace the conceptualisation and enactment of safety as revealed in dialogue and narrative, use of artefacts and space, bodily activity and patterns of movement, and in the accomplishment of specific work tasks. An interview phase and a social network analysis phase will subsequently be conducted to offer comparative perspectives on the observational data. This multi-modal and holistic approach to studying patient safety will complement existing research, which is dominated by instrumentalist approaches to discovering factors contributing to error, or developing interventions to prevent or manage adverse events. Discussion. This ethnographic research framework, informed by the principles of practice theories and in particular actor-network ideas, provides a tool to aid the understanding of patient safety in mental healthcare. The approach is novel in that it seeks to articulate an 'anatomy of patient safety' as it actually occurs, in terms of the networks of elements coalescing to enable the conceptual and material performance of safety in mental health settings. By looking at how patient safety happens or does not happen, this study will enable us to better understand how we might in future productively tackle its improvement.

In this context, I propose that the conceptual and methodological baggage that goes with Actor-Network theory (ANT) can be transformed into a fundamental resource for renewing and enriching the analysis of collective action. To achieve this, I focus on two main contributions of ANT to social thought: i) its alternative understanding of social action and ii) its alternative definition of the ""collective"". Both contributions, I will affirm, allow the opening up of an interesting discussion about the possibility of articulating a non-dichotomic theory of collective action that differs from the dominant traditions in that it takes into account and incorporates the materially heterogeneous and relational character of social movements. To give an example of the fertility of this approach I will focus on an analysis of the actions and reactions of environmentalist groups during the DoÃ±ana's ecological disaster (1998-2002), in Spain.","Actor-Network theory; Dichotomism; Ecological crisis; Environmentalism; Science and technology studies; Social movements",,,,,,,"Ãlvarez Cobelas, M., DoÃ±ana era una fiesta (1998) El BoletÃ­n de la Biblioteca, , http://habitat.aq.upm.es/boletin/n6/amalv1.html, 6 June, Revised November 21, 2009; Juan, A., (1998) Saving DoÃ±ana: A Collective Effort?

Analyzing empirical materials from u-city development, this study traces and unpacks the interaction occurring around the u-city innovation and also identifies patterns of innovation, concentrating on negotiation and translation implementation. The findings imply that Korean approach has marginalized key issues relating to the development potential inherent in the combination of knowledge and technology and thus conflicts with broader development suggestions of participative design. Korean case reveals the essential role of participatory design in u-city development. U-city as a public utility should draw users' perspectives, its design should be heavily grounded in users' needs, and its design decisions should be based on a community consensus.

The topic of this study is to reconstruct, through narrations, the process of designing and implementing the new student dorms at LinkÃ¶ping University through the lens of household energy behaviour. In particular, we aim to investigate how the interactions between entities such as the builders, landlords, users, ventilators, heaters, climate and so forth co-perform energy behaviour in the setting of residential student buildings. Inspired by the actor-network theory, the study treats energy behaviour as a hybrid collectif. It is the relations and their heterogeneity that are important in this approach. The project studies how heterogeneous relations among everyday practices, human experiences and interactions with nonhumans enact energy use patterns.

It introduces the concept of ""site"" to help advance an understanding of the relationship between practice and knowing. The notion of site supports the intuition that knowing is both sustained in practice and manifests itself through practice. It also evokes the idea of knowledge as being rooted in an extended pattern of interconnected activities that only when taken in its living and pulsating entirety constitutes the site of knowing. In this paper, Ire view the different ways to conceptualise the relationships between knowing and practice, and Isho w how the idea of site adds to the existing body of work. Building on the results of a longitudinal study in the field of telemedicine, Ithen offer suggestions on aspects of practice where knowing manifests itself, and Iuse the concepts of ""translation by contact"" and ""at distance"" to explain how dispersed knowings are woven together and the power effect that can derive from these. Iconclude by reflecting on the implications of this radical view and the direction for future research.

However, notwithstanding the vast merit of each, they illuminate only certain aspects of technological mediation. This paper is a preliminary attempt at a philosophical reflection on technological mediation as such-deploying the concepts of 'transparency' and 'opacity' as heuristic instruments. Hence, we locate a 'theory of transparency' within several theoretical frameworks-respectively classic phenomenology, media theory, Actor Network Theory, postphenomenology, several ethnographical, psychological, and sociological perspectives, and finally, the ""Critical Theory of Technology."" Subsequently, we render a general, systematic overview of these theories, thereby conjecturing what a broad analysis of technological mediation in and of itself might look like-finding, at last, an essential contradiction between transparency of 'use' and transparency of social origins and effects.

The sustainable development discourse has always had a strong technological component and the literature boasts an enormous amount of debate on which technologies should be developed and employed and how this can most efficiently be done. The mainstream discourse in sustainable development argues for an eco-efficiency approach in which a technology push strategy boosts efficiency levels by a factor 10 and more in industrialised and developing countries. A minority argues for a socio-cultural lifestyle switch, relying on new values, quality of life, sufficiency and redistribution strategies, with calls for appropriate and soft technologies. It is remarkable, however, that the articles, books and policy debates on sustainability seldom explicitly draw in a discussion of the nature of technology, how technology influences and is influenced by society, and what this implies for sustainable development. The mainstream interprets technology as neutral and instrumental: technology is no more than an instrument to reach a goal; it cannot be judged on its intrinsic characteristics, only on its use. The alternative view often builds on an autonomous and substantive interpretation of technology: technology is an autonomous, almost uncontrollable power that fundamentally reshapes our culture. A more balanced approach seems to be growing in the research on socio-technical sustainability transitions where the focus shifts to the co-evolution of technology and society, and to the networks, seamless webs and complex multi-actor processes that may carry a sustainability transition forward. This approach builds on insights from recent traditions in the philosophy and sociology of technology, in particular the social construction of technology (SCOT) and actor-network theory (ANT). While this provides for a better understanding of the nature and potential role of technology in sustainability policies, it remains to be seen whether it will actually influence the choice between technologies. This article investigates the different conceptualisations of technology in the sustainability debate. It first distinguishes between different approaches of sustainability and how these are related to differing views on technology. It then moves on to how the socio-technical transitions research incorporates insights from contemporary philosophy and sociology of technology. It reflects on the potential of transitions research to give guidance in technology choices, suggesting that the transition approach might be strengthened by drawing in insights from critical theory of technology and by taking a more political stance in defining sustainable development.

The goal of this paper is to explore certain theories for our plans and actions in technology-enabled learning. Although presented as a successor to previous learning theories, connectivism alone is insufficient to inform learning and its support by technology in an internetworked world. However, because of its presence in massive open online courses (MOOCs), connectivism is influential in the practice of those who take these courses and who wish to apply it in teaching and learning. Thus connectivism is perceived as relevant by its practitioners but as lacking in rigour by its critics. Five scenarios of change are presented with frameworks of different theories to explore the variety of approaches educators can take in the contexts for change and their associated research/evaluation. I argue that the choice of which theories to use depends on the scope and purposes of the intervention, the funding available to resource the research/evaluation, and the experience and philosophical stances of the researchers/practitioners.","Activity theory; Actor-network theory; Change management; Connectivism; Evaluation; Implementation; Learning; Research; Social shaping of technology; Theory; Zone of proximal development",,,,,,,"Ally, M., Role and function of theory in online education development and delivery (2004) Foundations of educational theory for online learning, , T.

The site aims to foster new forms of social and participatory practices (peer critiquing, sharing, user-generated content, aggregation, and personalisation) within an educational context. One of the key challenges in the development of the site has been to understand the user interactions and the changing patterns of user behaviour as it evolves. The paper explores the extent to which four frameworks that have been used in researching networked learning contexts can provide insights into the patterns of user behaviour that we see in Cloudworks. The paper considers this within the current debate about the new types of interactions, networking, and community being observed as users adapt to and appropriate new technologies.","Activity theory; Actor-network theory; Cloudworks; Communities of inquiry; Communities of practice; Connectivism; Design based research; Frameworks; Social and participatory web practices; Social networking; Web 2.0",,,,,,,"Andrews, R., Haythornthwaite, C., (2007) The Sage handbook of e-learning research, , London: Sage; Arbaugh, J.B., Cleveland-Innes, M., Diaz, S.R., Garrison, D.R., Ice, P., Richardson, J.C., Swan, K.P., Developing a community of inquiry instrument: Testing a measure of the community of inquiry framework using a multi-institutional sample (2008) The Internet and Higher Education, 11 (3-4), pp. 133-136; Barab, S., Design-based research (2006) The Cambridge handbook of the learning sciences, pp. 153-169. , R.

Owing to its dynamic nature, RASI represents a quintessential actor network for weathering science, because it links task in the landscape with an active material practice and an alternative materialistic world-view recently called for in positivistic science, to create place. Using concept maps as an assessment tool, 571 college undergraduate students and 13 junior high school integrated science students (ages 12-13) were evaluated for increased learning potential between pre- and post-field experiences. Further, this article demonstrates that when students use RASI to learn the fundamental complex science of weathering they make in-depth connections between weathering form and process not achieved through traditional, positivistic weathering pedagogy. We argue that RASI draws upon inherent actor networks which allow students to link weathering form and process to an animate conceptualization of landscape. Conceptualizing landscape as sentient actor networks removes weathering science disciplinary connections and their inherent pedagogic practices. Our focus in this paper is not to challenge weathering ontology and epistemology, but rather to argue that there is a need for a pedagogical paradigm shift in weathering science.

We argue that produsage is not a model that determines a change in the traditional consumption/production paradigm through a series of essential preconditions (such as open participation, peer-sharing, or common ownership). Rather, we explain produsage as the open-ended result of a series of heterogeneous actor-networking strategies. In this view, the so-called preconditions do not explain produsage but have to be explained along with its establishment as an actor-network. Drawing on this approach, we discuss a case study of an open hardware project: the Arduino board, and we develop a perspective that maps the skills of human and non-human entities in produsage actor-networks, showing how skills are symmetrical, relational, and circulating.

We argue that there is no single 'assemblage urbanism', and therefore no coherence to arguing for or against the concept in general. Instead, we distinguish between three articulations between urban political economy and assemblage thought. While empirical and methodological applications of assemblage analysis have generated productive insights in various strands of urban studies by building on political economy, we suggest that the ontological application favored by McFarlane and several other assemblage urbanists contains significant drawbacks. In explicitly rejecting concepts of structure in favor of a 'naÃ¯ve objectivism', it deprives itself of a key explanatory tool for understanding the sociospatial 'context of contexts' in which urban spaces and locally embedded social forces are positioned. Relatedly, such approaches do not adequately grasp the ways in which contemporary urbanization continues to be shaped and contested through the contradictory, hierarchical social relations and institutional forms of capitalism. Finally, the normative foundations of such approaches are based upon a decontextualized standpoint rather than an immanent, reflexive critique of actually existing social relations and institutional arrangements. These considerations suggest that assemblage-based approaches can most effectively contribute to critical urban theory when they are linked to theories, concepts, methods and research agendas derived from a reinvigorated geopolitical economy.

Bruno Latour's provocative arguments are taken as a starting point to show that a sociological theory of action, based on Hartmut Esser's model of sociological explanation, is able to cope with these questions. In order to describe the interaction of human actors and non-human agents, we have, consequently, constructed a sociological model to explain hybrid systems. A car-driving experiment in which humans have to cooperate with computer-simulated driver assistant systems has been chosen to prove the potential of the model. The data show that human test persons indeed attribute agency to the technical systems. Additionally, they describe the relation of human and machine as symmetrical. Finally, we have discovered that test persons also tend to attribute responsibility for the achievement of certain objectives to the technical system - although the rules of the game distribute responsibility equally between humans and non-humans.

Kellogg Biological Station, Hickory Corners, 3700 East Gull Lake Drive, MI 49060, United States","Increasing incidents of widespread foodborne illness continue to highlight problems with industrialised food production. These problems emerge as a result of complicated interactions between humans and non-humans in food production networks. This article combines actor-network theory and political economy to critically examine foodborne illness, focusing on outbreaks related to industrially produced bagged salads from California. The article explores the evolution of the bagged salad, the emergence of Escherichia coli O157:H7, how E. coli O157:H7 enters the salad production network and the responses of industrial actors. While many continue to blame external nature for foodborne illness, doing so overlooks the fact that outbreaks are co-produced by humans and non-humans. Profit-driven industrial production designs play an important role in the emergence and spread of pathogens. While efforts to address outbreaks focus on controlling non-humans and adopting new technological fixes, effectively minimising foodborne illness may require a reevaluation of high-volume and centralised production systems.

GhostNet is a large-scale cyber espionage network which has infiltrated important political, economic, and media institutions including embassies, foreign ministries and other government offices in 103 countries and infected at least 1,295 computers. The following case study explores the influences of GhostNet on affected organizations by critically reviewing GhostNet documentation and relevant literature on cyber espionage. The research delves into the socio-technical aspects of cyber espionage through a case study of GhostNet. Drawing on Actor Network Theory (ANT), the research examined key socio-technical relations of Ghostnet and their influence on affected organizations. Implications of these findings for the phenomenon of GhostNet are discussed in the hope of raising awareness about the importance of understanding the dynamics of socio-technical relations of cyber-espionage within organizations.

The thesis was supervised by Mike Michael and Bill Gaver, examined by Lucy Suchman and Matthew Fuller. The degree was awarded by the University of London in October 2010. This text sets out the sociological importance and relevance for conducting an ethnography of design and users. In doing so I sketch out the rationale for the thesis, following perspectives in STS, the empirical approach I undertook as well as the research questions I pursued. Lastly, I present a chapter outline of the thesis including a brief summary of the major theoretical contribution of the thesis, namely the concept of the user-assemblage, which draws on the work of Deleuze and Guattari and contributes to developments after actor-network theory.","Actor-network theory; Assemblage; Ethnography; User-centered design",,,,,,,"Adam, B., (2005) Futures Told, Tamed and Traded, , http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/socsi/futures/ESRC%20PF%20Futures%20TTT.pdf, Retrieved 17th December 2010, from Cardiff University; Adams, V., Murphy, M., Clarke, A.E., Anticipation: Technoscience, Life, Affect, Temporality (2009) Subjectivity, 28 (1), pp. 246-265; Akrich, M., Beyond Social Construction of Technology: The Shaping of People and Things in the Innovation Process (1992) New Technology at the Outset: Social Forces in the Shaping of Technological Innovations, pp. 173-190. , Meinolf Dierkes & Ute Hoffman (Eds.), Frankfurt & New York: Campus Verlag; Akrich, M., The De-Scription of Technical Objects (1992) Shaping Technology/Building Society: Studies in Sociotechnical Change, pp. 205-224. , Wiebe Bijker & John Law (Eds.), Cambridge, Mass.: MIT; Akrich, M., User Representations: Practices, Methods and Sociology (1995) Managing Technology in Society: The Approach of Constructive Technology Assessment, pp. 167-184. , Arie Rip, Thomas J.

The aim of this study is to explore the narcocorridos in the daily lives of young people. I am interesting in this genre and its fans. During my ethnographic fieldwork I focused on the practices, contexts, senses and mediators that link that kind of music with its audience. In this paper I develop the idea of mediation proposed by Actor-network Theory and Theory of Mediation, and I explain how I have used it in the study of narcocorridos.","Actor-network theory; Mediator; Narcocorridos; Theory of mediation",,,,,,,"Astorga, L., (1995) MitologÃ­a del ""narcotraficante"" en MÃ©xico, , MÃ©xico, D.F.: UNAM; Astorga, L., (1997) Los corridos de traficantes de drogas en MÃ©xico y Colombia, , abril, ComunicaciÃ³n presentada en Metting of Latin American Studies Association, Guadalajara, MÃ©xico; Astorga, L., Notas crÃ­ticas.

The text ends with a brief look at the state of art of actor-network theory in Spain and an appraisal of a meeting titled Present and Future of Actor-Network Theory, which is the origin of our monograph. In this paper we put forward a very simple idea: Actor-Network Theory was born with certain relevance in Social Sciences when it diffracted in a myriad of different uses and applications. The main corollary of such an idea is also straightforward: the very difference between Actor-Network Theory and other perspectives in Social Sciences resides in the permanent diaspora and transition of the former.","Actor-network theory; Diaspora; Transition",,,,,,,"Callon, M., Struggles and Negotiations to define what is Problematic and what is not: the Sociology of Translation (1980) The Social Process of Scientific Investigation: Sociology of the Sciences Yearbook, , Karin Knorr, Roger Krohn and Richard Whitley (eds.), Boston: Reidel; Callon, M., Latour, B., Don't Throw the Baby Out with the Bath School!

In the same way, I suggest some possible subterfuges to go around those problems. Two are the problems and two are the subterfuges as well destined to tackle them. On the one hand, I face the problem of the magnitude and fidelity that ANT's descriptions demand, thoroughly detailed and local, which clashes with the requirements of sociological theory that seeks abstractions and regularities. The subterfuge I propose is the one called ""impressionist cartography""f. On the other hand, I bump into the difficulty of the irreversibility of mediations and the sanitized representations carried out, sometimes, by ANT. In order to fight this, I use the subterfuge oriented to adopt the premise of the ""inevitable dirtiness of mediations"".","Actor-network theory; ANT; Cultural heritage; Impressionist cartography; Mediations; Sociology",,,,,,,"Latour, B., VisualizaciÃ³n y cogniciÃ³n: Pensando con los ojos y con las manos (1985) La Balsa de la Medusa, 45-46, pp. 77-128; Latour, B., (1999) La esperanza de Pandora.

I wanted to study people crossing the street in this city and then compare their actions with those of the people in my hometown - Caracas. Since carrying out a comparison between two cities was time consuming, I decided to do my research in Barcelona only. Later on, for studying people crossing the street, I decided to consider traffic lights as a starting point. Then I undertook the task of preparing a field diary based on some of the notions of Actor-Network Theory as Bruno Latour puts them. I did not use his approach as a systematic set of concepts, but as a device for imagination, i.e., as a number of ways that promote and facilitate the re-creation of worldly events. In this essay, I briefly present a part of my research experience, and I focus on the following idea: we can compose a common world, a cosmos, from a seemingly discrete entity, in my case, a traffic light.","Actor-network theory; Imagination; Thick description; Traffic light",,,,,,,"Badiou, A., (1999) El ser y el acontecimiento, , Buenos Aires: Manantial; Beinart, J., The radio (2007) Evocative objects: things we think with, pp. 103-109. , Sherry Turkle (Ed.), Cambridge: MIT Press; Brown, S., Stenner, P., (2010) Psychology without Foundations.

Nevertheless, we believe that such analysis must take into account public policy' ability to incorporate complexity. In order to do so, we suggest the notion of ""integrality"". Thus, understanding cities as urban assemblies made up of multiple versions of reality leads us to rethink the notion of politics. Subsequently, the idea of public action is developed offering new, hybrid and non modern concepts of political subjects and democracy.","Actor-network theory; Integrality; Public action; Urban Governance",,,,,,,"Barry, A., Born, G., Weszkalnys, G., Logics of Interdisciplinarity (2008) Economy and Society, 37 (1), pp. 20-49; Bingham, N., Hinchliffe, S., Reconstituting natures: Articulating other modes of living together (2008) Geoforum, 39 (1), pp. 83-87; Blanco, I., Lowndes, V., Pratchet, L., Policy networks and network governance: towards greater conceptual clarity (2011) Political Studies Review, , en prensa; Blanco, I., Castro, M., Grau, M., (2010) Citizen participation in urban governance networks.

First, it reviews how the ANT principles of hybrid relationality and flat associativity are being adopted in urban studies to symmetrically expand the urban ecology to nonhumans and contest scalar conceptions of urban space and economy. Second, it proposes that ANT brings along an even more fundamental challenge related to the understanding of the city as a research object. While common understandings as a spatial object, political-economical entity and/or sociocultural form underlie its singular, stable and bounded character, ANT allows thinking the city as a multiple and decentered object. The notion of urban assemblages is introduced to account for the circulation and becoming of the city in multiple hybrid and translocal networks. Finally, it concludes by discussing some consequences of this examination of the city, especially the reassertion of the problem of complexity, especially urban complexity, if not as a starting point, then at least as a point of arrival for ANT.","City as object; Complexity; Flat associativity; Hybrid relationality; Urban assemblages",,,,,,,"Aibar, E., Bijker, W.E., Constructing a City: The Cerda Plan for the Extension of Barcelona (1997) Science, Technology & Human Values, 22 (1), pp. 3-30; Amin, A., Graham, S., The Ordinary City (1997) Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 22 (4), pp. 411-429; Amin, A., Thrift, N., (2002) Cities.
