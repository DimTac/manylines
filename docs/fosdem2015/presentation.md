## Visual Network Analysis
Network Visualisation to do exploratory data analysis!

- using Gephi
- using sigma.js (see Alexis' talk in one hour)
- agent smith
- manylines
---
## Visual Network Analysis
Key is spacialisation algorithm
Mathieu designed ForceAtlas 2 (PlosOne)

---
## First problem
visualize networks

on the web

without coding
---
## Second problem
network storytelling

---
## let's explore the wikipedia seealso "sexual deviance" graph

---
## network story writting

---
## Stack
- couchbase (yep we loved their presentation at FOSDEM 2014)
- node.js / express
- domino.js + handlebars.js
- sigma.js

### Scaling ForceAtlas 2 for the web
#### Web workers
workers
- using **web workers** so the computations are not done by the UI thread
- using **transferables** to perform zero-copy data transfer between UI and worker
---
### Scaling ForceAtlas 2 for the web
#### low-level
- working over a byte array representation of nodes and edges
- avoiding the **new** keyword to dodge browser implementation's quirks
- dropping any dynamic structures and functions
---
### Scaling ForceAtlas 2 for the web
#### Iterative Barnes-Hut
- building an iterative version of the Barnes-Hut optimization
---
## future
- complete web interface refacto and redesign
- impressed by odyssey.js storytelling design
- moving to react and baobab.js
- any ideas?
