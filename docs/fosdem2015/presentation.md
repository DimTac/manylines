## Visual Network Analysis
Network Visualisation to do exploratory data analysis!

- using Gephi
- using sigma.js (see Alexis' talk in one hour)
- agent smith
- manylines

---

## Visual Network Analysis
Key is spacialisation algorithm
Mathieu designed ForceAtlas 2 (PlosOne)

---

## First problem
visualize networks

on the web

without coding

---

## Second problem
network storytelling

---

## let's explore the wikipedia seealso "sexual deviance" graph

---

## network story writting

---

## Stack

- couchbase (yep we loved their presentation at FOSDEM 2014)
- node.js / express
- domino.js + handlebars.js
- sigma.js

---

## Scaling graphs for the web is hard

- Let's try d3

---

## ForceAtlas 2

---

### Scaling ForceAtlas for the web
#### Web workers

- using **web workers** so the computations are not done by the UI thread
- using **transferables** to perform zero-copy data transfer between UI and worker

---

### Scaling ForceAtlas for the web
#### low-level

- working over a byte array representation of nodes and edges
- avoiding the **new** keyword to dodge browser implementation's quirks
- dropping any dynamic structures and functions

---

### Scaling ForceAtlas for the web
#### Iterative Barnes-Hut

- building an iterative version of the Barnes-Hut optimization

---

## The future!

- Complete UI refactoring and redesign
- Impressed by oddysey.js storytelling and design
- Moving to react and baobab.js
- Any ideas?
